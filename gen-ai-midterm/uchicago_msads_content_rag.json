The additional 6 courses consist of 4 additional elective courses (100 units each); and 2 required thesis courses (100 units each) that culminate in the completion of a required written thesis or thesis project. The thesis will be an extension of students’ previously completed Capstone Project. 2-year program students are highly encouraged to complete a research Capstone (as compared to a traditional, industry Capstone) for various reasons. The longer degree timeline offers more time to engage in academic and professional development while maintaining the same rigorous core curriculum and access to UChicago’s faculty and data science network. The first 12 of 18 courses that students complete in the 2-year program follow exactly the same course progression as those in the 1-year, 12-course program. The 2-year program is not currently available to those in the Online program and/or those pursuing the MS in Applied Data Science on a part-time basis. When can I apply for the 2-year thesis track program? The application portal for the 2-year full-time option will open in September 2025. Applicants apply through the same portal as the standard MS in Applied Data Science program. The deadline to be considered for this track is December 4, 2025. There are a limited number of spots available in this new 2-year thesis track (18 courses) program. Those who are not admitted to the 2-year program will be automatically considered for the 1-year 12 course program unless they choose to opt-out of consideration. May I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program? No. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters).

Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools.

Deep Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Generative AI: Principles and Applications This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models.

The methods that belong to this class include liner programming, quadratic programming and mixed-integer programming. Second class of methods has been developed to optimize a simulation model. The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations. Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement. Real Time Intelligent Systems Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students.

Statistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’. Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques. Data Science for Healthcare Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial. Data Visualization Techniques In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards. Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives. Students will learn to identify the web analytic tool right for their specific needs; understand valid and reliable ways to collect, analyze, and visualize data from the web; and utilize data in decision making for their agencies, organizations or clients. By completing this course, students will gain an understanding of the motivations behind data collection and analysis methods used by marketing professionals; learn to evaluate and choose appropriate web analytics tools and techniques; understand frameworks and approaches to measuring consumers’ digital actions; earn familiarity with the unique measurement opportunities and challenges presented by New Media; gain hands-on, working knowledge of a step-by-step approach to planning, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data; utilize tools to collect data using today’s most important online techniques: performing bulk downloads, tapping APIs, and scraping webpages; and understand approaches to visualizing data effectively. Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement. Generative AI: Principles and Applications This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios.

Deep Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations.

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats.

These experiences tend to stay with us for a long time, often becoming the milestones of our lives — and highly negative memories can also become intrusive, coming to mind vividly and unexpectedly.\n\nA new study published in Nature Human Behavior adds a new layer to our understanding of why emotional experiences are so sticky. The team, led by Psychology PhD student Jadyn Park, found that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding by strengthening cohesion across brain networks. Using fMRI during more natural, narrative settings, the researchers were able to track how emotional moments triggered a more “integrated” state in the brain, where different networks that usually play separate roles become more coordinated with one another.\n\nMost prior research on emotional memory has used relatively simple stimuli, exploring reactions to single words or static pictures. But in everyday life, Leong notes, our memories come from complex, unfolding experiences, similar to a movie or a story. To further existing work on memory, the researchers wanted to understand how emotional arousal shapes memory in more natural settings.\n\nThey also wanted to look beyond individual brain regions, as prior studies focused heavily on areas like the amygdala and hippocampus. The team — which also included Kruthi Gollapudi BA ’25 and Jin Ke MA ’22 — suspected that increased integration across the brain plays a role in cementing a memory into the brain, making it more memorable.\n\nThe study combined existing fMRI datasets across institutions and sites to create a large sample. This brain imaging method allows researchers to measure the whole brain at once, giving them a more comprehensive picture of the areas and connections stimulated as study participants watched movie clips and listened to stories.\n\nThe researchers used three different methods to determine how emotionally salient various naturalistic stimuli were. They asked people to subjectively rate how emotionally arousing a particular scene was, they used a large language model to gauge how arousing scenes were, and they measured people’s pupil dilation as a physiological measure of arousal.\n\nThe researchers used the mathematical framework of graph theory to show that emotion strengthens memory by changing how the whole brain works together, versus just individual parts The team found that when participants were watching highly arousing scenes, the brain shifted into a more integrated state. In turn, this increased integration predicted how well people then remembered the scene.\n\n“Think of the brain as an orchestra made up of many different sections. Sometimes they play separately, and other times they come together in harmony — what we call an integrated state,” Leong explains. “Emotional arousal helps conduct this orchestra, bringing the sections together, and when that happens, our memories become more lasting”.\n\nThe findings could lead to medical interventions that could make memories more or less sticky. By stimulating or suppressing the parts of the brain network that function as the “bridges,” there’s an opportunity to increase or decrease the level of integration in the brain that strengthens memory.\n\n“We found that when participants are experiencing these highly emotional events, diverse brain regions tend to be more coordinated with one another, or are more integrated,” Park says. “If we can deliberately disrupt or enhance that integration, it may open the door to interventions that help weaken traumatic memories.”\n\nMore practically, the study offers a new set of tools to probe memories in different ways. It marks a major step in allowing researchers to better measure what makes emotional memories sticky.\n\nOriginally published by the Department of Psychology\n\n## People\n\n# Yuan Chang Leong\n\n# Jadyn Park",

These requests are processed through Uber’s algorithm, which must consider thousands of variables, from driver locations that update in real-time to surge pricing calculations that change based on current demand, to determine a match between driver and rider. In sharp contrast to static data, which resides in a dataset and remains unchanged from day to day, Uber’s algorithm is a prime example of streaming data, in which queries are submitted in real-time and an answer must reflect the newest and most updated information at hand.\n\n20 years ago, data infrastructure was typically built to handle static data, and those that needed to be “streamed” were updated periodically, in a process known as batch processing. However, this turned out to be a problem for time-sensitive information, such as when trading in the stock market or analyzing whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. How can an algorithm make accurate decisions when the data is more than a day old? A steep drop in market prices, or a stolen credit card, could have easily occurred within that window and altered how an algorithm makes a decision, creating significant delays that generated a lot of frustration for data scientists.\n\nAt that time, Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor Michael Franklin, now at the University of Chicago, was part of a team of researchers at UC Berkeley that took on the challenge of creating a system that could handle the large flow of data in real time. Simultaneously, researchers at MIT and Brown were doing the same thing. Their respective systems, along with the papers detailing them, were released in the early 2000s at the Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) and earned both groups the prestigious Test of Time award in 2025.\n\n“Research is often very ‘fad’-driven. People get excited about an idea and produce a lot of research relating to it, so a lot of the content in these conferences, and the Best Paper Award, is all in the moment,” Franklin states. “The idea behind the Test of Time award is that, looking back ten or 20 years from now, you gain a perspective on what work has lasting importance. So, it’s a real honor, because this is something that is given with a good deal of context and time that has gone by. We were very happy to receive this.”\n\nIn their paper, TelegraphCQ: Continuous Dataflow Processing for an Uncertain World, Franklin and his colleagues built off an existing system called Telegraph (named after Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley). The original Telegraph system was not designed for continuous data processing in real-time, so they expanded its capabilities to handle continuous queries — hence the addition of “CQ” to the name. The system leverages PostgreSQL, one of the earliest open source database systems, which uses SQL as its main programming language. In contrast, the MIT/Brown paper created a brand new system and interface language, which required more coding effort and a steeper learning curve for users.\n\n“We broke fewer things,” Franklin reflects. “PostgreSQL has turned out to be by far the most popular of open source database systems so we were way ahead of our time. It was a natural choice for usbecause it came out of Berkeley, so we knew the people who built it originally. We extended an existing database system instead of building everything brand new, and we used as much as we could.”\n\nWhile some of the TelegraphCQ design decisions proved to be prescient, others were perhaps a bit too radical. For example, TelegraphCQ implemented a novel and aggressive form of adaptive query optimization. In a traditional database system, a query is written in SQL and compiled into an internal program before returning the answer. During this compilation process, the program analyzes all the different ways to get an answer and returns the most efficient one, based on different assumptions about the data and what will be done with it. In TelegraphCQ, they took an adaptive approach. As the data is constantly changing in real time, the most efficient query method is also altered on the fly, such that the chosen method is never constant as a query progresses. This created a few problems, including a degree of performance unpredictability beyond what is preferred for many real-world applications.\n\nStream query processing, despite its advances at the time, did not make as much of a splash in the early 2000s as Franklin and his colleagues had expected. In hindsight, there was not a huge market at the time for a continuous database system because companies and organizations that were using a lot of data had already streamlined their business processes around batch processing, in which they wait overnight to update the database and receive answers the next day. Most business processes at the time were not built to react immediately to new and constantly updated information, except for specific use-cases like credit card fraud detection, where hand-coded solutions had already been created for that purpose.\n\nNow, businesses are catching up. In addition to the competitive advantage of being able to process data at a greater pace than a competitor can, the introduction of AI has made continuous processing an even more important feature. What used to be people sitting at the other end of a query are now AI agents that can run constantly in the background, making adaptive processing of streaming data a much more optimal fit.\n\n“This is a classic example of a case where academics were willing to work on things decades before the market was ready for them,” Franklin stated. “Eventually, the techniques and the technologies that we came up with finally became valuable, because the market caught up. I believe that is why the awards committee decided to give the Test of Time award to us and to the MIT/Brown group. We made this bet. It didn’t look like the best bet for many years, but now it turned out to be a big deal.”\n\nTelegraphCQ led to the founding of Truviso, a company that was later acquired by Cisco. Their foundational work, alongside the MIT/Brown collaboration, influenced the creation of multiple pioneering stream-processing frameworks, such as Kafka Streams and Apache Spark Structured Streaming. Apache Spark, co-founded by Franklin, became one of the most popular open-source big data processing systems used today.\n\nLooking ahead, Franklin is dedicated to modernizing data management in the age of AI. His research focuses on three key areas: enhancing the integration of AI models and data management, building data systems optimized for AI agents, and collaborating with other researchers to create a universal data processing system that can handle image, video, and other non-traditional data formats.\n\n“I love doing research in academia because we get to work on practical problems that were arguably ahead of their time, but that a company probably wouldn’t necessarily invest in,” Franklin says. “This is how we are building the computer science department here at UChicago. We are recruiting students and faculty who are motivated by practical problems and are willing to take intellectual risks to try new things.”\n\nThis story was reposted from the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science\n\n## People\n\n# Michael J.

For Land Together, an organization in California that supports individuals transitioning back into the community, timing is everything.\n\nBut until 2025, their work faced a technical bottleneck: to identify people scheduled for release, staff had to manually comb through the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) website—a process that could take days, and which often left them scrambling to provide support at the last minute.\n\n“We’d find out about a person’s release the day of, or the day before, giving us very little time to prepare, let alone connect with the person before they’re out,” explained Cindi Prado, Reentry Administrative Coordinator at Land Together. “It meant we were playing catch-up when we could have already been supporting someone.”\n\nFurthermore, the CDCR website was updated sporadically, such that by the time staff finished combing through it, their data was sometimes superseded by new information. With Land Together hoping to expand across California to serve more people, they knew their existing approach wouldn’t scale.\n\n*\n\nLand Together’s situation reflects a broader challenge many nonprofit organizations face: while the private sector has embraced automation and data analytics, many community-based organizations remain trapped in manual processes that consume precious staff time and limit their impact.\n\nThe partnership between Land Together and the Data Science Institute began at a convening hosted by the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Family Foundation and the 11th Hour Project. There, Land Together’s team met with data scientists who recognized the challenge of tracking releases as one technology could readily solve.\n\nAfter working with the Land Together team to understand their workflow and needs, Trevor Spreadbury, a Software Engineer at the DSI, developed an automated web scraping solution that monitors the corrections department website and updates Land Together’s records with the latest data on program participants’ release date and timing. “The script runs automatically every night so each morning they have the most up to date information,” Spreadbury explained, adding, “It was important for the tool to be sustainable long term. From a technical perspective, the script is simple, extremely inexpensive, and has required no maintenance nearly a year in. From an operational perspective, it is incorporated directly into Land Together’s existing systems meaning their staff hasn’t had to learn new tools or worry about remembering some arcane set of steps. It gets that manual work out of the way so they can focus on providing direct support.”\n\nNow, “this scraper has saved so much time and is more accurate than what we did before,” said Prado. “It supports our entire Reentry Team of six people and indirectly benefits our 372 incarcerated participants by helping ensure we have the most up-to-date information available.”\n\nThe Land Together partnership illustrates how targeted technical assistance can dramatically amplify a nonprofit’s capacity without requiring them to hire additional staff or develop in-house technical expertise. By automating routine data collection, they can redirect human resources toward their core mission, particularly crucial for volunteer-driven organizations (Land Together was entirely volunteer-run until 2011), where every hour spent on manual data processing is an hour not spent providing direct services. The automated system doesn’t just save time; it enables the organization to be more responsive and proactive in their work: “[We] are now using the updated information in our participants’ files to generate reports about participants who have been found suitable at their parole hearing,” added Prado. “This has been extremely helpful!”\n\nMoreover, as Land Together expands their geographic reach, the technical solution scales with them. What might have required a dedicated team of volunteers and staff to monitor release data across counties can now be handled by updating a script.\n\n“Land Together’s challenge is a frequent one for nonprofits,” said Susan Paykin, Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science at the DSI. “These organizations often don’t have the same resources as industry, the same IT infrastructure or technical staff. So you have people in direct service spending their limited time on data entry and website monitoring, ancillary tasks that could be automated, instead of the things they’re uniquely able to do. Our hope is that tools like this one can integrate seamlessly into an organization’s workflow, so their team can really adopt it, make it their own, and update it to grow with them.”\n\nThe Data Science Institute’s work in Community-Centered Data Science is dedicated to addressing specific community needs in sustainable ways: rather than building complex systems that require ongoing technical maintenance, the focus is on creating tools that organizations can actually use and maintain over time. The approach recognizes that the most elegant technical solution won’t succeed if it doesn’t fit within an organization’s existing workflows and capacity.\n\nLearn more about the DSI’s collaborations with 11th Hour Project grantees as the centralized hub for software and data science here.\n\nLand Together staff and volunteers at a prison farmers market, part of the organization’s broader mission to support individuals impacted by incarceration.

As data science and AI’s reach extends to nearly every facet of life, how can the digital native generation marshal its skills to drive social impact?\n\nTo open this discussion to the community, the Data Science Institute (DSI) and The Patrick J McGovern Foundation (PJMF) co-hosted the event Tech-for-Good Careers: A Community-Centered Approach to Data and AI Innovation.\n\nSpeaking in a fireside chat about the future of data science and technology with DSI Faculty Co-Director and UChicago Distinguished Service Professor Dan Nicolae, Vilas Dhar, President of The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, inspired responsibility and optimism: “We’re really good at building amazing things,” Dhar said, but these should be informed by “a commitment to a society founded in equity and justice. The conversation about technology begins with what our society should look like.”\n\nDhar emphasized the vital role the rising generation of data scientists will play in the direction AI takes: “Ethical AI [is] fundamentally a human function. We are encoding the values of a moment, embedding them in the tools we’re using to analyze the world around us.” He underscored the central place of academic spaces in both leading the conversations about what the future will look like and actively shaping that future, saying: “These are the rooms where that [building] happens.”\n\nThe evening’s agenda highlighted ways UChicago faculty, staff, and students are leveraging data science for social good.\n\nAlumni Paths to Using Tech for Social Impact\n\nThe program kicked off with a panel where alumni traced their career journeys. Launa Greer (MSCAPP ’21) spoke about her path as a software engineer working for a consulting firm to working in the social impact space: “I was looking for opportunities to blend tech together with service and policy. [While in graduate school] I took a project-based class with the DSI Data Science Clinic, helping a nonprofit track deforestation caused by the palm oil industry, and it was addictive,” she said. Launa now serves as a staff software engineer at the DSI, partnering with social impact organizations through The 11th Hour Project Software and Data Hub.\n\nAlumni paths ventured beyond traditional engineering roles as well: Andrew Fan (BA ’13), explained how journalism at the Invisible Institute, where he serves as Executive Director, grows out of innovative analyses conducted with direction from community voices. Speaking about the genesis of the Invisible Institute’s 2023 investigation “Missing in Chicago,” which earned a 2024 Pulitzer Prize in local reporting, Fan said, “We didn’t start out with missing persons. We actually found it through data-based inquiry. We created a system where we were looking at huge troughs of police complaints to identify patterns in police handling, teaming with community volunteers to help us understand.”\n\nKayecee Palisoc (MSCAPP ’24) knew she wanted to apply her skills to structural issues but didn’t know how. As a DSI Community Data Fellow in 2023, Palisoc was able to assist the State of Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion’s financial inclusion program. “That was my first exposure to government work,” she said, “and looking back that led me to my current role.” Today, in her work with the City of Chicago’s Department of Technology and Innovation, she serves as a liaison between technical providers and the City.\n\nAlums shared advice for students preparing to enter the workforce fulltime, encouraging students to “try to get into the community and work with organizations to discover their needs.” Greer emphasized that “tech is most effective when it’s really rooted in the needs of the community, rather than the flashy new thing.”\n\nShe further advised students to “own your skills development,” and reminded them to leverage the community they build on campus: “You might be the most technical person in your organization,” she said, “but you have a network that extends beyond it that you can draw on.”\n\nResponsible Data Science: What Does It Mean in 2025?\n\nHighlighting social impact data and AI case studies, Hazem Mahmoud, Director of Products and Services at PJMF, shared some of the principles the Foundation applies throughout development from ideation to testing, deployment, and maintenance, which included ensuring tools remain people & community-focused, and keeping humans in the loop during production. He presented examples of tools that PJMF has developed with this approach to address needs ranging from access to clean water in refugee camps to financial due diligence tools for grant makers.\n\nMahmoud emphasized the vital role of data scientists and engineers in 2025: “If you think about tech today, it impacts how we spend our time together, the relationships we have, the values we decide we want to keep as a society, and that’s a huge responsibility.” He encouraged students to meet this challenge proactively by asking questions, educating themselves through coursework in ethics, and advocating in their work to “take the time to contribute to open-source tools that protect users and communities.”\n\nIllustrating the Data Science Institute’s own approach to community-centered data science, Dylan Halpern, Full-Stack Software Engineer at DSI and Susan Paykin, Senior Associate Director of Community-Centered Data Science, presented PalmWatch, a recent social impact data science project. This project began in 2021 when nonprofit Inclusive Development International connected with the DSI, with support from The 11th Hour Project, to quantify the impacts of the palm oil industry on deforestation and hold responsible corporations to account. The DSI team developed scripts to clean, extract, and standardize information from public reports to estimate the area affected by individual mills. The team then packaged these findings into PalmWatch, a public web tool where users can not only examine past impact but also estimate future deforestation risk by mill, company, brand, and country. The DSI has since continued its collaboration with IDI and PalmWatch through work with the Data Science Clinic.\n\nThe concluding poster session and reception showcased student-led work in community-centered data science research and applications. Students didn’t shy away from challenges, mapping access to public libraries with an eye to greater equity, and developing natural language models to enable more efficient and ethical institutional purchasing practices.\n\nAnother student team trained LLMs to identify problematic loans for BankTrack, an organization that tracks the activity of private banks. One of these students, Jack Sanderson (BS ’27), was inspired to continue exploring the space. He has since focused on AI safety and security and expressed excitement after the event to continue applying frontier technologies to real-world problems.\n\nThe Path Ahead\n\nCommunity-centered data science is core to the DSI’s mission of research, holistic education, and cross-disciplinary partnerships. Since 2021, the DSI has served as the centralized hub for data science and software for the 11th Hour Project, a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, which supports nonprofits across its programs in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, indigenous communities, and marine technology. Through this partnership, the DSI hosts its Data Science Clinic, which provides direct support to social impact organizations while offering opportunities to inspire the next generation of public interest data scientists.\n\nThe DSI also aims to broaden participation in technical and data science fields. Programming such as the Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Summer Experience and Data4All provide rigorous yet supportive research environments for undergraduate and high school students to engage with real-world data science problems.\n\nOverall, Tech-for-Good Careers attracted a diversity of students, with not only data scientists but aspiring data journalists at UChicago and Chicagoland high school students in attendance. As Dhar said in conversation with Professor Nicolae, “In many ways, the students in this room are the ones who are going to architect this space.” If the evening’s engagement was any indication, UChicago students are up to the challenge.\n\nDSI NewsFeb 22, 2024 PalmWatch, a new tool created by DSI’s 11th Hour Project team, sheds light on palm oil production across the globe\n\n## PalmWatch, a new tool created by DSI’s 11th Hour Project team, sheds light on palm oil production across the globe\n\nDSI NewsOct 07, 2024 Bringing Transparency to Carbon Credit Projects\n\n## Bringing Transparency to Carbon Credit Projects\n\nDSI NewsMay 14, 2024 Data science clinic students’ work visualizing compostable packaging disintegration data from the compostable field testing program presented at COMPOST2024\n\n## Data science clinic students’ work visualizing compostable packaging disintegration data from the compostable field testing program presented at COMPOST2024\n\nDSI NewsJun 14, 2023 Data Science Clinic students solve real-world problems, gain lifelong skills\n\n## Data Science Clinic students solve real-world problems, gain lifelong skills\n\nDSI NewsAug 29, 2024 DSI Celebrates Culmination of 2024 Summer Programs\n\n## DSI Celebrates Culmination of 2024 Summer Programs\n\nDSI NewsSep 15, 2023 Community Data Fellows Create Data Solutions for Nonprofits\n\n## Community Data Fellows Create Data Solutions for Nonprofits\n\nDSI NewsJan 09, 2023 New DSI Open Spatial Lab Brings Expertise to Social Impact Organizations\n\n## New DSI Open Spatial Lab Brings Expertise to Social Impact Organizations\n\nDSI NewsOct 29, 2024 Supporting Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Voter Education with North Dakota Native Vote\n\n## Supporting Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Voter Education with North Dakota Native Vote\n\nDSI NewsApr 24, 2025 DSI and The Patrick J.

          "content": "## Share\n\nEmail page on Facebook (opens new window)\n\nShare page on X (opens new window)\n\nEmail Page (opens new window)\n\nWhen you rush into an emergency room, you may notice the pace, the urgency, and the concentration on every face. What you probably never consider is this: Could the notes your doctor writes about you contain clues about how tired they are—and could that fatigue spill over into decisions about your care? New research from a team featuring Associate Professor Chenhao Tan from the Department of Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Chicago explores this very question, using advanced language models to read between the lines of over 129,000 clinical notes.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Communications and co-authored by phd student Chao-Chun Hsu, Ziad Obermeyer from UC Berkeley, and Tan, shines a spotlight on the written traces of physician fatigue in emergency departments and issues a warning about relying on AI to write or interpret medical notes.\n\n### READING FATIGUE BETWEEN THE LINES\n\nMedical notes aren’t just administrative paperwork; they help summarize each patient’s story, diagnosis, and treatment plan. But hidden within the words, Tan’s team discovered, are consistent signals of a physician’s fatigue state—particularly after a grueling week of emergency shifts.\n\nThe researchers trained a computational model to distinguish notes written by doctors who had worked at least five of the last seven days—a classic recipe for fatigue—from those penned by more rested physicians. The model didn’t just pick up on obvious differences. Instead, it zeroed in on subtle, interpretable features: the predictability of each word, the complexity of the writing, and even the emotional tone of certain phrases.\n\n“This was a surprise to us,” expressed Tan. “We were surprised how the predicted fatigue is robustly correlated with other independent measures of high fatigue such as overnight shifts and high patient volumes.”\n\n### FATIGUE IN TEXT, AND ITS IMPACT ON CARE\n\nThis predictability, the core task of modern large language models, became a useful indicator: Fatigued doctors wrote more formulaic notes and used fewer words expressing insight (like “I believe” or “I think”), less often used first-person pronouns, and sometimes even produced a greater proportion of tense or angry language. These textual signals aligned not just with grueling shift schedules, but also with classic signs of burnout such as working overnight or seeing particularly high patient volumes.\n\nBut does a tired-sounding note mean a patient gets lower-quality care? The answer, at least in the emergency department, is: sometimes yes. The researchers found that every increase in the model’s predicted fatigue score was linked to a 19 percent drop in the yield from a critical decision—testing for heart attacks, a life-or-death call in ER medicine. Instead of simply tracking the number of recent shifts, the model’s fine-grained, note-specific fatigue estimate proved more closely tied to this important performance measure.\n\n“Traditional measures of fatigue may not capture the nuance from encounter to encounter,” stated Tan. “As a result, it may not capture subtle shifts in decision quality, especially given that measurable decision signals can also be rare in healthcare. To give an example, it can take a long time to detect a misdiagnosis.”\n\n### CAUTION FOR AI: MORE FATIGUED THAN THE DOCTOR?\n\nThe study comes at a time when hospitals are looking to artificial intelligence for help with documentation, decision support, and even drafting parts of the clinical record. The researchers put popular AI language models to the same test—and found a surprising result: Notes drafted by large language models not only mimicked the “fatigued” patterns identified by the human-authored fatigue model, but did so even more strongly. In fact, the “fatigue” score for LLM-generated text was 74% higher than that of real physician notes.\n\nIf these models are used indiscriminately to generate or summarize patient notes, they could, in effect, amplify the very communication problems linked to tired human doctors.\n\n“Writing is thinking,” said Tan. “AI may improve productivity and reduce physician fatigue, but it should not result in notes that ‘look’ fatigued.”\n\n### TOWARDS RESPONSIBLE AI—AND BETTER CARE\n\nThe authors urge caution, but also see opportunities. Instead of fully automating notes, AI could be used to help physicians focus on the most meaningful aspects of patient care—perhaps by flagging repetitive or predictable sections for streamline, or prompting for more nuanced observations.\n\nThe findings have implications far beyond scribbles in the hospital’s back office. They suggest new benchmarks are needed—to ensure that both human and artificial authors of medical notes provide documentation that genuinely supports high-quality care, and to remind us that behind every line of text is a clinician, subject to the same daily rhythms and strains as anyone else.\n\nAs hospitals and technology firms continue to roll out AI assistants, this research—rooted in the expertise of Professor Chenhao Tan and his colleagues—will be essential reading for everyone invested in the future of healthcare.\n\nThis story was originally published by the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science\n\n## People\n\n# Chenhao Tan\n\nPaperOct 24, 2025 Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\n## Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\nCampus NewsSep 03, 2025 A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\n## A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## A Data Science Solution to Amplify Nonprofit Impact at Land Together\n\n## Looking Back 20 Years: How an Academic Bet on Real-Time Data Finally Paid Off\n\n## Moderation at the Crossroads: How Generative AI Platforms Manage Creativity and Content Safety\n\n## Congratulations to Outgoing Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellows",

Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”\n\nAnother student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation particularly captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She went on to say that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz the most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all of the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.\n\n#### A day to remember\n\nThe trip to Google offered UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students a unique opportunity to connect with industry leaders, explore cutting-edge technology, and experience the vibrant Google culture. This unforgettable experience is sure to inspire and motivate the students as they launch their data science careers.\n\nApplied Data ScienceDec 04, 2023 MS in Applied Data Science Students Present Research at National Conference\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science Students Present Research at National Conference\n\nApplied Data ScienceFeb 13, 2024 MS in Applied Data Science shares career advice with Stagg High School students\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science shares career advice with Stagg High School students\n\nApplied Data ScienceJun 14, 2024 Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2023 Capstone Winners\n\n## Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2023 Capstone Winners\n\nApplied Data ScienceJul 18, 2024 Summer 2024 Hackathon Winners Announced\n\n## Summer 2024 Hackathon Winners Announced\n\nApplied Data ScienceOct 22, 2024 Applying to the MS in Applied Data Science Program?

We’re thrilled to have you here! Our program is designed for ambitious problem-solvers ready to make a difference in fields ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond. To help you put your best foot forward, we’re sharing a few key traits we look for in applicants. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.\n\nTrait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R\n\nLet’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.\n\nKnow your data types—strings, Booleans, integers, floats, all that jazz. And if you’ve played around with data frames or created some basic data visualizations, you’re on the right track.\n\nIf this sounds foreign, don’t panic! There are great resources to help you get up to speed without breaking the bank. Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python).” He also honed his skills through Kaggle and Datacamp competitions.\n\nIn short, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is key.\n\nTrait #2: Collaboration is Key\n\nOur students are movers and shakers, ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics—you name it. Transitioning from theory to real-world impact means working well with others. We look for students who are:\n\nTeam Players: You’re comfortable working alongside people from different backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nCommunity Builders: You want to be part of our community, help build it, and stay connected even after graduation.\n\nYou’ll learn a lot from our faculty, but also from your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about hitting the books.\n\nTrait #3: Be Authentic\n\nJust be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you even start (otherwise, why would you need us?). Be open about where you need to grow, but also proud of what you bring to the table.\n\nAuthenticity goes a long way. It helps us understand who you are and how you’ll fit into and contribute to our community.\n\nSo, if you’re thinking about applying, keep these traits in mind. We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!\n\nTrait #4: Relax and communicate effectively\n\nStudents must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of their application requirements, a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting in front of the camera and review the video before submitting. Make sure you are speaking loudly and calmly. We encourage students to not read off of a script so you do not sound robotic. This is a chance for students to show their personality and effective communication skills. Also, it is recommended for students to treat the video requirement as if they are interviewing for a position; professional attire is encouraged.\n\nPresenting is common in our program, don’t worry if it’s not perfect as students will have plenty of opportunities to practice in the program.\n\nApplied Data ScienceMay 28, 2024 A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students\n\n## A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students\n\nApplied Data ScienceJun 03, 2024 Master’s in Applied Data Science Winter 2024 Capstone Winners\n\n## Master’s in Applied Data Science Winter 2024 Capstone Winners\n\nApplied Data ScienceNov 25, 2024 Top Data Science Skills Employers Are Looking For\n\n## Top Data Science Skills Employers Are Looking For\n\nApplied Data ScienceDec 03, 2024 Danny Ng’s Path to Becoming a TA in UChicago’s Applied Data Science Program\n\n## Danny Ng’s Path to Becoming a TA in UChicago’s Applied Data Science Program\n\nApplied Data ScienceDec 17, 2024 Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n\n## Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n\nApplied Data ScienceDec 17, 2024 Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase\n\n## Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase\n\nPast EventNov 12, 2024 Data Science Seminar Series\n\n## Data Science Seminar Series\n\nPast EventNov 25, 2024 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (In-Person Program)\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (In-Person Program)\n\nPast EventNov 18, 2024 Ask a Student in MS in Applied Data Science\n\n## Ask a Student in MS in Applied Data Science\n\nPast EventFeb 24, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (Online Program)\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (Online Program)\n\nPast EventFeb 26, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (In-Person Program)\n\nPast EventSep 16, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (Online Program)\n\nPast EventOct 23, 2025 Info Session – MS in Applied Data Science (In-Person Program)\n\n## Info Session – MS in Applied Data Science (In-Person Program)\n\nPast EventOct 28, 2025 Ask a Student in MS in Applied Data Science\n\nUpcoming EventNov 10, 2025 Ask a Student in MS in Applied Data Science (Online Student)\n\n## Ask a Student in MS in Applied Data Science (Online Student)\n\nUpcoming EventNov 13, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (Online Program)",

I am interested in developing methods in machine learning that are driven by the distinct challenges and opportunities in the natural sciences, with particular interest in physics-inspired machine learning methods. Some areas of exploration include general learning strategies exploring the relevance of physical inductive biases and ML models for scientific problems, the advantages that ML can bring to classical physics-based numerical solvers (such as through end-to-end differentiable frameworks and implicit layers), and better learning strategies for distribution shifts in the physical sciences. These methods are informed by and grounded in applications in atomistic and continuum problems, including fluid mechanics, molecular dynamics, and other related areas. This work also includes interfacing with other fields including numerical analysis, dynamical systems theory, quantum mechanics, computational geometry, optimization, and category theory.\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## Winter 2026 Data Science Clinic Information Session\n\n## Rama Ranganathan (UChicago): Schmidt AI in Science Speaker Series\n\n## Chicago Data Night: Dr. Alan Keahey (Epsilon)\n\n## Chenhao Tan (UChicago): Schmidt AI in Science Speaker Series",

Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science and AI researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and applications that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.\n\nAbstract: “Life” and “intelligence” are terms with heavily contested meanings. This talk will present a novel perspective on both, beginning with the surprising observation, first made by von Neumann around 1950, that general computation is at the heart of any living system. Experiments in artificial life (ALife) have now allowed us to observe the emergence of life from random initial conditions (abiogenesis), in the process suggesting a central role in evolution for “symbiogenesis,” the symbiotic merger of existing replicators to form novel ones. When computational entities enter into symbiotic relationships, they must model each other, and when they merge, computational parallelism enables them to become both more complex to model and more powerful as modelers. The ensuing “intelligence explosion” feedback dynamics are familiar to evolutionary neurobiologists who have explored the relationships between troop size and brain scaling among highly social animals, including hominins. In the perspective presented here, the evolution of life, the major evolutionary transitions (including the emergence of nervous systems and brains), intelligence explosions among highly intelligent species, and even the development of advanced technologies like AI can be understood as stages in an ongoing process of computational symbiogenesis.\n\nBio: Blaise Agüera y Arcas is a VP and Fellow at Google, where he is the CTO of Technology & Society and founder of Paradigms of Intelligence (Pi). Pi is an organization working on fundamental research in AI and related fields, especially the foundations of neural computing, active inference, sociality, evolution, and Artificial Life.\n\nIn 2008, Blaise was awarded MIT’s TR35 prize. During his tenure at Google, Blaise has innovated on-device machine learning for Android and Pixel; invented Federated Learning, an approach to decentralized model training that avoids sharing private data; and founded the Artists + Machine Intelligence program.\n\nA frequent public speaker, he has given multiple TED talks and keynoted NeurIPS. He has also authored numerous papers, essays, op-eds, and chapters, as well as two previous books, Who Are We Now? and Ubi Sunt. His most recent book, What Is Life?, is part 1 of the larger book What Is Intelligence?, published September 2025.\n\n## Agenda\n\n### Friday, November 14, 2025\n\n#### Lunch\n\nLunch will be provided on a first come, first serve basis.\n\n#### Talk & Q&A",

Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science and AI researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and applications that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.\n\nAbstract: This talk reviews diffusion methods to identify low-dimensional manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets, and illustrates that by pinpointing additional mathematical structure, improved results can be obtained. Much of the talk draws on a case study from a collaboration with biological morphologists, who compare different phenotypical structures to study relationships of living or extinct animals with their surroundings and each other. This is typically done from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks) on e.g. bones; such landmarking draws on highly specialized knowledge. To make possible more extensive use of large (and growing) databases, algorithms are required for automatic morphological correspondence maps, without any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user.\n\nBio: Ingrid Daubechies is the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Duke University. Her sprawling research career has touched fields as diverse as art restoration, evolutionary biology, electrical engineering and, most notably, image and data processing. Her most famous contributions concern wavelets, mathematical structures vital for modern signal processing.\n\nShe is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Academia Europaea. She is a 1992 MacArthur Fellow and served as president of the International Mathematical Union from 2011 to 2014. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the National Academy of Sciences Award in Mathematics, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, the Bakerian Medal, the National Medal of Science, the Nemmers Prize, the Fudan-Zhongzhi Science Award and the Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research.\n\n## Agenda\n\n### Friday, March 27, 2026\n\n#### Lunch\n\nLunch will be provided on a first come, first serve basis.\n\n#### Talk & Q&A",

Statistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Applied Generative AI: Agents and Multimodal Intelligence This course explores Advanced Generative AI with a focus on multimodal modeling, a transformative AI paradigm integrating diverse data types—text, images, audio, video, time-series, and point clouds.

Deep Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Generative AI: Principles and Applications This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios. Machine Learning Operations The objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.

Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding. Optimization and Simulation Methods for Data Science This course introduces students to how optimization and simulation techniques can be used to solve many real-life problems. It will cover two classes of optimization methods. First class has been developed to optimize real, non- simulated systems or to find the optimal solution of a mathematical model. The methods that belong to this class include liner programming, quadratic programming and mixed-integer programming. Second class of methods has been developed to optimize a simulation model. The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations. Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement. Real Time Intelligent Systems Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students.

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.

The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n\nAdvanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats.

We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n\nThis course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications.

But that whirring is enabling pioneering work: for researchers across the University of Chicago, this GPU cluster is pushing the boundaries of knowledge across disciplines. From simulating thousands of years of weather systems in order to predict extreme climate events, to forging new ground in understanding human behavior, access to high-performance computing is letting researchers across campus tackle some of the world’s most complex research problems.\n\nBut what exactly is a GPU cluster, and why does it matter? It’s a collection of interconnected computers each equipped with specialized processing units (GPUs) that work together as a single system to solve problems. Together, they can process massive datasets, run sophisticated machine learning models, and perform calculations that would take your typical laptop weeks or months to complete.\n\n“In launching the cluster, we hoped researchers would feel empowered to take on bigger and more complex questions than was previously possible,” said Mike Franklin, DSI Faculty Co-Director and Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Computer Science, who was part of the team that first proposed the undertaking. “Looking at the outcomes, they demonstrate how computational resources have really transformed what’s achievable on campus.”\n\nWhile not every research project the cluster contributes to, either directly or indirectly, can be directly identified, authors have called out the cluster’s contribution in over 90 publications. Featured in major artificial intelligence conferences (including NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR) and high-impact journals (among them Physical Review B, Journal of Computational Physics, and SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science or SIMODS), some of this work is already influencing how we think about AI and research methodology across domains.\n\nHere’s a glimpse into the diversity of research across campus leveraging high-performance computing:\n\n## Predicting Extreme Weather in a Changing Climate\n\nIn recent years, advances in computing have exponentially increased the possibilities of weather forecasts. Pedram Hassanzadeh, Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Faculty Director of the AI for Climate Initiative, and his team are using the cluster to investigate how machine learning can improve weather forecasting to better understand and predict our changing climate.\n\n“The speed, storage, and staff support of this cluster allow us to bridge traditional atmospheric physics with cutting-edge machine learning approaches: we can train neural network-based atmospheric models on observations and high-resolution simulations, generate many weather realizations with them, and robustly study variability, especially that of extreme events,” said Hassanzadeh. “We can also conduct controlled experiments, for example by training these neural networks many times with carefully designed datasets, to do hypothesis testing. These approaches would have been prohibitively expensive just a few years ago.”\n\nBy leveraging these computational advances, Hassanzadeh and his team are developing novel learning strategies to keep pace with climate change to predict and prepare for weather events.\n\n## Understanding How the Brain Processes Real-World Information\n\nHistorically, study of the brain was limited to relatively brief responses to stimuli, but computational advances have exploded the possibilities.\n\nYC Leong, Assistant Professor of Psychology and Director of the Motivation and Cognition Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Chicago said, “The DSI computing cluster has been transformative for our research. We are a computational cognitive neuroscience laboratory that studies how the brain processes complex, real-world experiences using full-length movies and TV episodes,” explained Leong. “The cluster allows us to integrate state-of-the-art vision and language models with massive fMRI datasets to predict how the brain responds to rich and naturalistic audiovisual content. No individual lab could maintain the level of storage and computational power needed to run these large-scale analyses. Without the DSI Cluster, tackling questions at this scale, with the latest computational tools, would simply not be feasible.”\n\nBy studying the brain under more naturalistic circumstances, his Lab is investigating how people understand social narratives and make predictions about others’ behavior, examining everything from how hostile attribution bias shapes neural responses, to how emotional arousal enhances memory formation during storytelling.\n\n## Capturing the Subtleties of Language\n\nMachine learning is also enabling more complex linguistic analysis than ever before. Chenhao Tan, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science and his team are exploring applications across a range of disciplines. As just one example, Tan’s research group developed a framework for analyzing political discourse that makes concrete the uniquely divisive nature of presidential communication patterns. Their work was published in PNAS Nexus and recently referenced in The New York Times.\n\n“We needed to process and analyze massive datasets of human behavior drawn from millions of posts and notes across different data sources,” said Tan. “This kind of large-scale analysis of data simply wasn’t feasible before. The DSI cluster allowed us to train large language models to detect subtle linguistic patterns in texts. This kind of analysis opens up a new world of possibilities for how AI can help us understand social dynamics, information spread, and human behavior as a whole,” he said, adding, “We couldn’t do this work without it.”\n\n## Forging New Paths in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nIn addition to enabling interdisciplinary research, the cluster is supporting breakthrough research in the rapidly-growing data science, AI, and machine learning space.\n\nVictor Veitch, Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science, and his team have produced award-winning research on how large language models encode concepts, including work that won the Best Paper Award at ICML 2024. Their papers “Uncovering meanings of embeddings via partial orthogonality” (Jiang et al., NeurIPS 2023) and “On the origins of linear representations in large language models” (Jiang et al., ICML 2024), as well as a more recent presentation at ICLR on “The geometry of categorical and hierarchical concepts in large language models” (Park et al., ICLR 2025 Oral) have already been cited across domains including vision-language models, mechanistic interpretability, and concept engineering.\n\n“The computational demands of modern AI interpretability research are enormous,” said Veitch. “To understand how language models represent concepts, we need to run thousands of experiments across different models and datasets. The cluster lets us conduct rigorous scientific investigations of AI systems at scale, which is critical for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI.”\n\nAri Holtzman, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science, is building on his foundational work in neural text generation (his 2019 paper “The Curious Case of Neural Text Generation” is now used in OpenAI’s API) to tackle the next frontier: understanding how AI systems can be aligned with human values and ensuring they behave reliably and safely.\n\n“Our research investigates what large language models can and can’t do, and what entirely new capabilities emerge when humans work with them,” Holtzman explained. “To understand these complex systems, we need to systematically probe them—through creative prompting, targeted finetuning, model surgery like deleting or swapping components, and deep dives into their internal mechanisms. All this requires massive computational resources, which would be difficult without the cluster’s parallel processing power.”\n\nTian Li, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science, uses the cluster to advance techniques that facilitate machine learning across distributed systems while preserving privacy.\n\n“Modern machine learning research increasingly requires experiments across hundreds or thousands of scenarios to ensure robustness,” Li explained. “Being able to do this efficiently has allowed us to quickly iterate on new ideas and validate theoretical insights.”\n\nEspecially as artificial intelligence becomes more ubiquitous, UChicago researchers are playing an important role in defining the field.\n\n## Preparing the Next Generation\n\nOften, high-performance computing has been accessible only to researchers with substantial grant funding, or access to specialized supercomputing facilities. But the cluster provides the resources for discovery across career stages, and is frequently used by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.\n\nThe cluster also serves as a crucial training resource through programs like the Data Science Clinic. Nick Ross, the Data Science Clinic Director, spoke about the importance of cluster access in training the next generation of data scientists: “When students can iterate quickly on complex models or analyze datasets that would have been impossible to work with just a few years ago it changes how they think about problems and problem solving. They start approaching problems differently, no longer constrained by the limitations of the laptop in front of them. Through programs like the Data Science Clinic, students are graduating with hands-on experience using tools that are becoming increasingly essential across every field.”\n\n## The Team Behind The Cluster\n\nTo the end user, it may feel like magic–and that’s the idea. But behind the proverbial curtain, installing and maintaining all those servers, is the two-person team of Bennett Hunter and Maria Hernandez.\n\n“The easiest way to understand it,” explained Hunter, “is that the machines we use are able to do math incredibly fast. Decimals are more difficult for computers to process, but our system can perform about two quadrillion 64‑bit floating‑point operations per second, and each 64-bit number carries about 16 decimal digits of precision.”\n\nAs the cluster expands, each new compute node needs to be fit into the parallel processing system. “We use our own independent system to configure servers for the cluster. After we test it, we install it in the data center in a subbasement on campus. Then we rack it–” which seemed like the easiest part of the process, until Hunter clarified each piece can weigh up to 150 pounds, adding, “My first assignment was to set up five nodes at once.” Luckily, Hunter was joined earlier this spring by a first team member, Hernandez.\n\n“We’re engineers at heart, so we love to see this kind of state of the art technology,” Hunter said, “but the greatest piece of engineering is one someone can use without an instruction manual, so we’re committed to making the user experience as smooth as possible.”\n\nTo this end, they provide users training on how to use the cluster effectively and recently launched a website with guidance on how to get started as well as common uses.\n\nAs research becomes increasingly data-driven and computationally intensive, access to high-performance computing will only grow from luxury to necessity. “Often when new faculty join, one of the first questions we’re asked is, ‘How much compute is there?’ because it’s so vital to answering the research questions they’re exploring,” said David Uminsky, Executive Director of the Data Science Institute. “We are building a world class AI research institute, so it’s important to us to empower our researchers with the resources they need to pursue ambitious, high-impact work.”\n\nFrom fundamental questions about the nature of artificial intelligence to practical applications in neuroscience and climate science, our researchers’ accomplishments demonstrate how strategic investment in a shared computational infrastructure can serve as a force-multiplier, amplifying capabilities and catalyzing discovery across domains at UChicago.\n\nBlogJul 09, 2025 UChicago’s AI for Climate Initiative Leads New Approach to Modeling and Understanding Earth System\n\n## UChicago’s AI for Climate Initiative Leads New Approach to Modeling and Understanding Earth System\n\nDSI NewsMay 22, 2025 2025 Research Day Highlights Growth with Global Impact\n\n## 2025 Research Day Highlights Growth with Global Impact\n\nCampus NewsOct 15, 2024 UChicago Researchers Demonstrate the Quantifiable Uniqueness of Former President Donald Trump’s Language Use\n\n## UChicago Researchers Demonstrate the Quantifiable Uniqueness of Former President Donald Trump’s Language Use\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## A Data Science Solution to Amplify Nonprofit Impact at Land Together\n\n## DSI and The Patrick J.

Along with any major election, the electorate can expect a bevy of debates and political speeches from candidates. The 2024 election candidates include former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Previous reporting on Trump from prior campaigns has pointed to his distinctive language and claimed that it’s unlike any previous candidates’ language, but is that really true?\n\nIn a new paper, authors from the University of Chicago quantify the uniqueness of Trump using several metrics and tools, including large language models (LLMs). Doctoral student Karen Zhou, who is advised by Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science Chenhao Tan, led the research, to be published at PNAS Nexus.\n\n“This work was inspired by the desire to quantify the differences between Donald Trump and prior American presidents,” Zhou stated. “In particular, we hypothesized that portrayal of political opponents might be a distinguishing feature of his speech.”\n\nZhou and her co-authors developed a new language measurement technique and found that Donald Trump’s use of language is indeed unique among all presidential candidates since 1960. They categorized Trump’s language as divisive, particularly when mentioning political opponents.\n\n### HOW DO WE DEFINE UNIQUE, DIVISIVE SPEECH?\n\nTo support such claims, the authors had to create tools up to the challenge. They implemented three complementary approaches to allow for a multifaceted comparison. One of the approaches employed an innovative use of a large language model (LLM). Large language models are essentially text prediction algorithms that calculate the likelihood of the next words or phases, given a certain context. Based on the ability of LLMs to make these predictions, the authors created a metric called “uniqueness” that measured an individual’s probability of word phrases or sequences compared to other political candidates. For this group of political candidates, this measure compares how likely one speaker is to use the same language and phrasing as another candidate.\n\n“This is quite a creative way of using large language models,” Tan said. “The common practice is to evaluate large language models by how well it predicts the next word, but this approach uses large language models to inspect the political discourse.”\n\nThe second measure employed in this paper was a standardized definition of “divisive speech.” Defined as language meant to delegitimize or challenge the speaker’s target, classic divisive speech examples include calling a political opponent “stupid,” or “racist,” or “ridiculous.” The researchers created a lexicon of 178 words that are readily recognized as divisive and could be used by political figures regardless of party affiliation.\n\nThe third measurement employed by the authors was specifically interested in speech directed at a debate opponent. The authors selected mentions of opponents from presidential debates and calculated how a speaker’s rhetoric changes when referring to opponents versus in other political speech.\n\n### DONALD TRUMP DOESN’T SPEAK LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL CANDIDATE\n\nTo compare Donald Trump’s speaking style with past political candidates’ language, the researchers pulled from three sources: State of the Union addresses since 1961, presidential debates for general elections since 1960, and a selection of campaign speeches collected by the American Presidency Project.\n\n“Whether from the campaign trail or in office, these are among the most significant opportunities that presidents and presidential candidates have to speak to the American people,” Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics and a collaborator on this project, William Howell, stated. “The language they choose to employ, as such, comes to define their communication styles as presidents.”\n\nUsing these sources, they found Trump’s use of language was by far the most unique across all three data sources, with the most noticeable difference found during debates. Even when just comparing Trump to the average performance of both Democrat and Republican speakers, Trump remained an anomaly.\n\nSimilarly, using the lexicon of divisive words, Trump was found to employ divisive language most frequently. In campaign speeches, he was particularly likely to use “crazy” (135 times), “corrupt” (111 times), and “stupid” (69 times). His most divisive language appeared during debates, but he ranked as the most divisive across all forms of political speech measured here.\n\nFinally, Trump was more likely than others to mention his political opponents specifically. And when talking about his opponents, he referred to them with more distinctive language than other candidates did.\n\n“Trump routinely cast himself as apart from, and in a fight against, the dominant political order,” Howell remarked. “This oppositional stance, in vital respects, shaped the particular ways that Trump talked about his many political opponents.”\n\nIt’s easy to discard the opinion of a pundit or politico when they make sweeping statements about the uniqueness of Donald Trump. But at least when it comes to language use, Trump is an outlier case. Since the early 1960s, there hasn’t been a political candidate quite like him. And we now have data across three separate measures that demonstrates that.\n\n“Presidential speech has far-reaching social effects,” Zhou said. “ It is important to identify the features of such rhetoric so that we can measure their impacts, especially for Donald Trump, who many intuitively consider an outlier politician.”\n\nA preprint version is available here.\n\nThis work was funded in part by the Data & Democracy research initiative, a collaboration between the Data Science Institute and the Center for Effective Government at the University of Chicago.\n\nThis story was republished from the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science\n\nResearch Initiative Data & Democracy\n\n## Data & Democracy\n\nPaperOct 24, 2025 Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\n## Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\nDSI NewsSep 30, 2025 Powering Discovery: How Advanced Computing is Transforming Research Across Disciplines\n\n## Powering Discovery: How Advanced Computing is Transforming Research Across Disciplines\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## A Data Science Solution to Amplify Nonprofit Impact at Land Together\n\n## Looking Back 20 Years: How an Academic Bet on Real-Time Data Finally Paid Off\n\n## Can a Doctor’s Notes Reveal When They’re Tired?

AICE aims to leverage the power of AI and machine learning to accelerate and transform the theory and practice of weather and climate analysis and prediction.\n\nLaunched in September 2024, this interdisciplinary effort combines climate physics, computer science, economics, applied and computational math, statistics, public health, and the social sciences to pioneer new models for climate and weather prediction and to inform global efforts on adaptation and resilience.\n\n“AICE is among the first of its kind at a university,” said Pedram Hassanzadeh, Faculty Director of AICE and an Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Computational and Applied Mathematics. “Other programs typically have a narrower scope that’s either limited to one or two disciplines or centered solely on deep learning applications as a new tool. By building a wide coalition of researchers, including those focused on socioeconomic impacts and adaptation and mitigation strategies, our program is helping position the University of Chicago as a leader in this space.”\n\nA joint program of UChicago’s Data Science Institute and the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth, AICE has already notched several early successes that have helped advance its mission to revolutionize and democratize climate science and weather forecasting. Here’s a look at some of its recent accomplishments.\n\nExpanding Access to Accurate Forecasts\n\nOne of AI’s biggest advantages is its ability to dramatically reduce the computational cost of running climate and weather models.\n\n“Traditional, physics-based models have grown more and more complex and expensive, with long-range forecasts requiring the world’s most powerful supercomputers,” said Hassanzadeh, who helped develop the first working AI-based weather forecast model, NVIDIA’s FourCastNet. “AI is far more efficient, for example, by a factor of 100,000. A properly trained high school student with a laptop can now produce state-of-the-art forecasts, though they would need help interpreting them.”\n\nThis shift has profound implications for many around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which often lack access to high-performance computing but face acute risks from extreme heat and other climate impacts.\n\n“There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to address the growing impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities,” said Amir Jina, who co-leads AICE with Hassanzadeh. Jina is a development economist at the Harris School of Public Policy. “Our research has demonstrated that countries have an opportunity to better protect their economies from climate uncertainties by improving weather forecasting.” For example, research conducted by Jina and colleagues has shown that improved monsoon forecasts help farmers make better decisions—such as how much to plant, what to plant, or whether to plant at all—ultimately leading to smarter investments and greater resilience. “Through our projects, we aim to empower people with actionable climate information, and ensure they have the tools to adapt and thrive in an increasingly uncertain environment.”\n\nThe group has partnered with global efforts to enhance climate resilience, such as Agriculture Innovation Mission for Scale (AIM for Scale)—a joint initiative between the United Arab Emirates and the Gates Foundation, for which Jina chairs the technical panel on weather forecasting.\n\nAt COP29, the UN’s most recent climate change conference, AIM for Scale announced a $1 billion package to boost weather services for farmers in LMICs, which included funding to support a research and training program led by AICE.\n\nAICE is developing state-of-the-art AI models and training government officials—initially from 30 countries in the tropics and global south—on how to use them effectively, in partnership with the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFocus on the Long Term\n\nAICE also aims to improve its AI models for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts. Current AI models outperform the physics-based models for 1- to 10-day forecasts, but like the physics-based models, do not offer much skill beyond these lead times. However, longer range forecasts, from around two weeks to 6 weeks, offer valuable climate insights and decision-making opportunities that shorter ones cannot, such as helping farmers to make strategic decisions on such concerns as crop planning, resource use, and risk management well in advance.\n\nImproving S2S forecasting requires large climate datasets, advanced computing power, and deep expertise in areas such as data science and climate domain science. UChicago’s partnership with Argonne National Laboratory plays a critical role in AICE’s efforts to improve S2S models.\n\n“Both institutions play a key role in developing successful AI for Climate projects. Each has AI and domain science expertise, while Argonne provides the exascale computing resources and the University brings the workforce needed to advance projects,” said Jiwen Fan, co-director of AICE and deputy division director of the Environmental Science Division at Argonne. “By combining our strengths, we can take a leadership role in the development of better S2S forecasts.”\n\nThis partnership is also crucial to AICE’s work in climate science. Physics-based climate models currently serve as the gold standard for understanding historical climate patterns, projecting future trends, and testing adaptation, mitigation, and climate engineering strategies. Yet, just like traditional weather forecasting models, they are computationally expensive, as well as slow to run and challenging to scale.\n\nScientists have recently begun turning to AI emulators to more quickly produce climate projections. These tools learn from decades of physics-based simulations and observational data, allowing researchers to quickly run many “what if” scenarios and explore possible futures more efficiently.\n\nThese tools, however, come with challenges. Their accuracy depends heavily on the data they’re trained on, and they may struggle with unfamiliar or extreme situations. In fact, just recently, Hassanzadeh and colleagues showed the challenges of AI models with the rarest, most extreme weather events, so-called “gray swans,” calling for innovation at the intersection of AI, mathematics, and climate physics, one of the major goals of AICE.\n\nWith these limitations in mind, researchers at AICE are working to benchmark and better understand AI climate emulators, testing how well their predictions match reality and where they fall short, to ensure they’re both fast and trustworthy. Such work can pinpoint where new innovations are needed to build better physics-informed AI tools for the next-generation of weather and climate modeling.\n\nThis work, while in its infancy, holds the potential to democratize access to climate projections much in the same way AI can for weather forecasting.\n\n“If we can demonstrate that these emulators show considerable skill and reliability for rare and extreme events or for weather pattern changes, and build up a group who know how to use them, that could be transformative,” said Tiffany Shaw, Director of AICE and Professor of Geophysical Science. “That’s the real opportunity for AI tools like this – bringing new knowledge to more people who can use it to make strategic decisions while reducing the uncertainties we currently face.”\n\n## People\n\n# Pedram Hassanzadeh\n\n# Amir Jina\n\n# Tiffany Shaw\n\n# Jiwen Fan\n\n# Ian Foster\n\nResearch Initiative AICE: AI for Climate\n\n## AICE: AI for Climate\n\nCampus NewsSep 03, 2025 A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\n## A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\nDSI NewsSep 23, 2025 Weather Forecasting Training Program Bringing the Power of AI to Low- and Middle-Income Countries\n\n## Weather Forecasting Training Program Bringing the Power of AI to Low- and Middle-Income Countries\n\nDSI NewsSep 30, 2025 Powering Discovery: How Advanced Computing is Transforming Research Across Disciplines\n\n## Powering Discovery: How Advanced Computing is Transforming Research Across Disciplines",

Sessions demonstrated the breadth of the DSI’s work in fields from internet access to biology, and showcased partnerships across campus and beyond–from the University of Chicago Law School and the Harris School of Public Policy, to the Illinois Office of Broadband and national governments.\n\nThe day drew members of the UChicago community as well as industry partners. “Today’s audience and agenda really underscore the DSI’s dual role as a hub for interdisciplinary research on campus and a meeting point for collaborators using AI to drive innovation beyond academia,” DSI Faculty Co-Director and Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor Michael Franklin said in his opening remarks.\n\nRead on for highlights touching on data privacy, democratizing AI and internet access, and more.\n\n#### From Revolutionizing Weather Forecasts to Improving Data Ecosystems\n\nThe DSI’s newest initiatives, AI for Climate (AICE), Complementary AI, and Data Ecology, shared their accomplishments since launching last spring.\n\nFrom the AI for Climate Research Initiative (AICE), Faculty Directors Pedram Hassanzadeh, Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences, and Tiffany Shaw, Professor of Geophysical Sciences explained how AI has precipitated a revolution in weather forecasting by making weather simulations faster, lower cost, and more accurate than ever, enabling earlier event prediction and expanding access to millions globally.\n\nAs one example, in the past year, the AICE team has partnered with the Indian government to share AI-supported forecasts with 50 million Indian farmers on a weekly basis via text message. In an environment where monsoons can upend a season’s worth of cultivation (and livelihood), better forecasts could empower farmers to make cultivation choices that work with the weather rather than against it. Through a collaboration with the Gates Foundation and the government of the United Arab Emirates, the AICE team plans to further democratize forecast access over the next three years by training government forecasters across 30 low- and middle-income countries.\n\nFaculty Directors of the Data Ecology Initiative Assistant Professor of Computer Science Raul Castro Fernandez and Assistant Professor of Law Bridget Fahey shared how in an increasingly data-driven world, rather than simply patching problems as they arise, their team is studying how to design data systems to maximize data’s value while controlling its use and impact. As just one illustration of why this is needed, the team pointed to the informal market for personal data between governmental organizations. Professor Fahey published a recent article in The Atlantic on the risks of such unregulated exchange.\n\nFahey and Fernandez propose as an alternative a system that collects, protects, and tracks queries of data. Professor Fernandez has already developed the blueprint for such an alternative—the data escrow—which incentivizes data quality and lets stakeholders follow how data is used.\n\nAssociate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science Chenhao Tan and Professor of Sociology and Director of the Knowledge Lab James Evans shared the latest concepts from the Complementary AI Initiative, including the challenges of leveraging AI to complement human intelligence when users reward AI for alignment with their own values.\n\nRepresenting the Internet Innovation Initiative (III), Faculty Director and Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and the College Nick Feamster recapped his team’s work testing the limits of internet speed measurement to facilitate real-time solutions.

Drawing on her background in climate finance and consulting, Sophie joined a Clinic project with Invenergy, a company dedicated to advancing cleaner, more reliable, and affordable energy solutions. This experience not only deepened her technical skills but also opened doors to a full-time role at Invenergy.\n\nInvenergy, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is a valued member of DSI’s Industry Affiliate Program. This program connects industry partners with cutting-edge data science research and emerging technologies, and creates natural opportunities to recruit some of the brightest minds in data science. Through its involvement, Invenergy actively participates in the Data Science Clinic, where students collaborate in teams to tackle real-world challenges as data scientists working with industry clients.\n\nNick Ross, Data Science Clinic Director and Associate Senior Instructional Professor at the DSI, highlighted the value of DSI’s partnership with Invenergy: “We are proud to count Invenergy as one of our Industry Affiliates. The team is passionate about partnering with students for impact and our work together has led to some truly groundbreaking opportunities. We’re grateful to have such supportive and creative partners like Invenergy powering our work at the DSI.”\n\nHands-On Experience with Real-World Data\n\nWhen Sophie joined the clinic team as a student, she was drawn to the opportunity to work at the intersection of her interests, focusing on a computer vision project. “It was exactly where I wanted to be,” she said. “I’d done forecasting projects before, but this computer vision project was entirely new territory for me.”\n\nThe experience was a steep but rewarding learning curve. “Working with high-resolution climate data was unlike anything I’d done in the classroom,” Sophie explained. “In class, we’d covered computer vision abstractly, but handling vast datasets firsthand taught me so much more.”\n\nBut for Sophie, the most valuable aspect was building relationships. “I loved working with the Invenergy team. When a full-time position opened up after graduation, I already knew the team and how well we worked together. That made the decision to join an easy one.”\n\nFrom Clinic to Career\n\nSophie credits her clinic experience with her ability to transition into the renewable energy industry. She had the real-world experience to know what questions to ask and how to stand out as she searched for the right role to utilize the skills and knowledge she gained from the MSCAPP program. Once she joined the Invenergy team, she in many ways picked up where she left off, collaborating with the same colleagues and expanding the original clinic project to its next natural iteration.\n\nThe project Sophie supported went on to win the 2024 Invenergy Innovation Award, a fantastic achievement for her and her colleagues on the data science team at Invenergy. The award recognized “outstanding contributions towards building a sustainable culture of innovation,” demonstrating the significant impact clinic projects can make both for a business and the broader ecosystem.\n\n“In the clinic, we focused on the most technical aspects, but as an employee, I’ve gotten to work on the full scale of what it means to be a data scientist—everything from scoping projects to collaborating with subject matter experts like mechanical engineers,” Sophie shared.\n\nShe emphasized how impactful the clinic was as a complement to traditional coursework. “You can spend 10 weeks in class learning concepts, but 10 weeks solving a real-world problem gives you depth and knowledge you’ll be ready to apply.”\n\nA Day in the Life of a Data Scientist\n\nToday, Sophie’s role at Invenergy includes a mix of focused technical work and big-picture thinking. She spends much of her time refining the model she began in the clinic and has also been able to support organization-wide initiatives, like exploring new applications of generative AI.\n\nShe’s even come full circle, now mentoring a new Invenergy clinic project with current DSI students, focused on applications of generative AI to parse and analyze energy tariffs. “It’s been so fun to coach them and see how quickly they’ve made progress.”\n\nSophie has also passed on her wealth of experience to current students when she joined a group at the University this October to discuss her journey as a data scientist and offer valuable insights from her career.\n\nLessons Learned and Advice for Students\n\nReflecting on her journey, Sophie credits curiosity and relationship-building as the keys to her success. “Follow your genuine curiosity—it will lead you to interesting conversations and projects,” she advised.\n\nShe’s also a strong advocate for authentic networking. “It’s not about being transactional; it’s about building connections. You never know how those relationships might turn into opportunities, even years down the line.”\n\nSophie frequently shares one piece of advice from a mentor, Associate Professor of Computer Science and co-founder of the MSCAPP program, Anne Rogers: “Focus on ‘skills, not scores.’ Grades won’t get you a job, but the portfolio you build and the relationships you cultivate will.”\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSophie’s journey from data science student to data scientist underscores the value of hands-on learning. “I almost wish I’d done a second clinic project,” she said. “It’s such a unique chance to solve real-world problems while still in school.”\n\nNow, Sophie is not only advancing the renewable energy industry with her work but also shaping the next generation of data scientists through her mentorship—proving that curiosity, hard work, and collaboration can truly power change.\n\nMore information: Data Science Clinic; Industry Affiliate Program; MSCAPP\n\nDSI NewsJun 09, 2025 Celebrating This Year’s Successes in the Data Science Clinic\n\n## Celebrating This Year’s Successes in the Data Science Clinic\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## A Data Science Solution to Amplify Nonprofit Impact at Land Together\n\n## Powering Discovery: How Advanced Computing is Transforming Research Across Disciplines\n\n## Looking Back 20 Years: How an Academic Bet on Real-Time Data Finally Paid Off\n\n## Can a Doctor’s Notes Reveal When They’re Tired?

Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.

Deep Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations.

But when it comes to 4-digit multiplication, a task taught in elementary school, even state-of-the-art systems fail. Why? A new paper by Computer Science PhD student Xiaoyan Bai and Faculty Co-Director of the Novel Intelligence Research Initiative Chenhao Tan, along with collaborators from MIT, Harvard, University of Waterloo, and Google DeepMind, reverse-engineers failure and success to find answers.\n\nAs you may remember (or have forgotten), multiplying larger numbers requires carrying over digits, and mentally “holding on” to partial products so you can add them up to get your final product. Processes that require storing information for later use in this way are called “long-range dependencies.”\n\nStandard models work by learning to recognize patterns in the data they’re trained on. But the more complex a problem gets, the less likely a model is to have seen it specifically. So how do you teach a model to not just memorize answers but learn a process?\n\n## Why Standard Training Fails\n\nModels are often taught new tasks via standard fine-tuning (SFT), which relies on scaling up the training data, or adding more steps or “layers.” But even when the research team tested models with 2 layers all the way up to 12 layers, they all achieved less than 1% accuracy on 4×4 digit multiplication. Why were the standard approaches failing here?\n\nThe researchers found that under the SFT approach with gradient descent (an iterative optimization algorithm), models converge to a “local optimum:” the best solution in a given dataset. However, this approach doesn’t account for those long-range dependencies.\n\nThe problem isn’t lack of training, the team found. Rather, the model is trapped: without an architecture that lets it store and retrieve intermediate information, it can’t step beyond that local optimum, no matter how long it trains, or how large it scales.\n\n## What ICoT Does Differently\n\nNext, the researchers identified a model trained using a different method: Implicit Chain of Thought (ICoT). Where SFT achieved less than 1% accuracy, the ICoTmodel was able to achieve 100% accuracy. To understand what this approach was doing differently, the team took both apart to uncover some fundamental insights:\n\nThe ICoT model learns to remember what matters. Unlike the SFT model, the ICoT model learned to track those “long-range dependencies.” The team verified this by testing whether they could decode intermediate values (like running sums) from the models’ internal states. In the ICoT model, they could; in the standard model, they couldn’t. The ICoT method gradually removes intermediate reasoning steps during training, in a sense forcing the model to internalize the reasoning process in its hidden states rather than relying on explicit step-by-step tokens.\n\nThe ICoT model organizes its attention into branches across time. Think of it like a well-organized filing system: in early layers, the model computes products of digit pairs and stores them at specific locations. In later layers, it retrieves exactly the “cached” products needed for each output digit. This creates an efficient directed graph for implementing the multiplication algorithm, a structure the standard model never develops.\n\nMathematics rendered in geometric form: Perhaps most remarkably, the model represents digits and their operations using elegant mathematical structures. Digits are encoded using wave-like patterns (Fourier bases) that form a pentagonal prism shape in the model’s internal representation space. When multiplying digit pairs, the model uses a natural geometric operation called a Minkowski sum, which notably wasn’t programmed by the researchers, but rather emerged naturally during training in the ICoT model. It’s as if the successful model derived its own efficient mathematical language for arithmetic.\n\n## A Simple Fix\n\nIf the SFT models’ struggle with long-range dependencies was about missing inductive biases, then providing the right training signal should fix it. To validate their understanding, the team introduced a simple solution: they added an “auxiliary loss” that trains lightweight linear probes to predict running sums at each step, capturing and carrying intermediate values and partial products.\n\nIt turned out that making this one addition to the 2-layer model that completely failed under standard training did the trick. The result: 99% accuracy without explicit chain-of-thought supervision.\n\nInspecting this model’s attention patterns revealed it learned similar mechanisms to ICoT—the sparse binary tree structure for caching and retrieving partial products. However it had developed additional strategies too: including an “attention head” allowing it to simultaneously track all necessary digit pairs.\n\n## Novel Intelligence and the Jagged Frontier\n\nWhile multiplication might seem a specific kind of task, the findings illuminate fundamental aspects of how transformers learn and “think.” The long-range dependency problem isn’t unique to arithmetic; it appears throughout language modeling and other sequential tasks, and demonstrates AI’s “jagged frontier,” that is, its capacity to excel at complex reasoning, yet stumble on seemingly simple tasks.\n\nThe team’s approach asks foundational questions about the distinctions between memorization and learning, and what architectural constraints help or hinder models’ performance.\n\n“As AI is increasingly integrated into critical decision-making, it’s essential to understand its unique ways of learning and thinking,” said Tan. “Our research is trying to chart that terrain.”\n\nThis paper’s key contribution: architectural insights and training techniques can overcome obstacles that scaling alone cannot address. The right inductive biases, not just more parameters or data, are key to pushing AI capabilities forward. While the auxiliary loss solution is task-specific, the researchers anticipate future work will develop more general approaches to improve learning on tasks requiring long-range dependencies.\n\n## People\n\n# Chenhao Tan\n\n# Xiaoyan Bai\n\nResearch Initiative Novel Intelligence\n\n## Novel Intelligence\n\nCampus NewsAug 04, 2025 Can a Doctor’s Notes Reveal When They’re Tired?

His research in the Chicago Human+AI (CHAI) Lab blends data science, natural language processing, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and computational social science to develop and evaluate tools for human-AI collaboration.\n\n“There are rich opportunities for AI to improve high-stakes decision making and bring positive benefits to billions of people,” Tan said. “However, it remains unclear how to best fit AI into the decision making process. The black-box nature of current AI models limits possible human-AI interaction and makes full automation highly undesirable, especially given the mounting evidence that AI may rely on spurious correlations and cause harm.”\n\nAs an alternative, Tan develops models around principles of data-driven insights and human-centered explanations. His past research has looked at social media data to determine how to construct more persuasive arguments and the likelihood of information going viral, and has explored what tasks humans are comfortable delegating to AI and how a “machine-in-the-loop” system can assist with writing tasks.\n\nLast year, Tan received a Google Research Scholar award to study how natural language models, such as the headline-grabbing GPT-3 system, can be made more robust and harder to trick through making how they arrive at their outputs more transparent. He also organized a Human + AI conference at UChicago, convening prominent experts in this burgeoning field to think about the potential of this technology for society.\n\nRecently, he has investigated how to create more effective explanatory responses from AI by incorporating human goals, intuitions, and prior knowledge. A 2023 paper, with PhD students Han Liu and Chacha Chen, postdoctoral researcher Shi Feng, master’s student Yizhou Tian, and assistant professor Yuxin Chen, built a decision support system that leverages human perception of similarity to support its conclusions.\n\nFor instance, in recommending that a chest-xray should be diagnosed as pneumonia or not, it provides a similar-looking example – by human standards, not according to machine learning parameters – for user comparison. Their learned human-compatible representations enable laypeople to achieve an accuracy of almost 80% in pneumonia classification.\n\nAdditional work has examined whether customizing AI explanations to the prior knowledge base of users can help augment their decision-making process, instead of merely replicating it. Amidst the recent hype around GPT-3 and applications such as ChatGPT – and the attendant fears about computers replacing human work – Tan sees opportunities for creating more constructive AI assistants for workers in any field.\n\n“I think a lot of AI work is about emulating what a human can do. My interest is more about extending what people can do,” Tan said. “AI can know what questions that people typically miss and help people ask that question to get the information that they need. On the flip side, AI can also help people process information. It’s useful to know what knowledge people already have, then we can tailor AI to best complement their existing knowledge and provide the most valuable information for each individual.”\n\nTan is the second UChicago CS faculty member to receive the Sloan Research Fellowship in two years. In 2022, assistant professor Pedro Lopes received the honor for his research on human-computer integration.\n\nPaperOct 24, 2025 Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\n## Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\nCampus NewsJul 05, 2023 Sixteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships\n\n## Sixteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships\n\nCampus NewsFeb 20, 2024 Five UChicago scholars awarded prestigious Sloan Fellowships in 2024\n\n## Five UChicago scholars awarded prestigious Sloan Fellowships in 2024\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## A Data Science Solution to Amplify Nonprofit Impact at Land Together\n\n## Looking Back 20 Years: How an Academic Bet on Real-Time Data Finally Paid Off\n\n## Moderation at the Crossroads: How Generative AI Platforms Manage Creativity and Content Safety\n\n## Can a Doctor’s Notes Reveal When They’re Tired?

It will also draw on business and economics to measure and model human-AI productivity; legal and policy expertise to propose models by which AI can assist in the regulation of other AI; and tools and insight across the sciences, engineering, arts, and humanities to align AI with human needs and values. These efforts will grow human-AI potential to grapple with the greatest challenges facing humanity together.\n\n### Leadership\n\nJames Evans Max Palevsky Professor of Sociology & Data Science; Director, Knowledge Lab; Faculty Co-Director, Novel Intelligence\n\n# James Evans\n\nChenhao Tan Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science; Faculty Co-Director, Novel Intelligence\n\n# Chenhao Tan\n\nMy research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but I am also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human understanding and action through crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of distributed sensors (e.g., RFID tags, cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create alternatives to current discovery regimes.\n\nMy research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force office of Science Research, and many philanthropic sources, and has been published in Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Social Studies of Science, Research Policy, Critical Theory, Administrative Science Quarterly, and other outlets. My work has been featured in the Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, NPR, BBC, El País, CNN, Le Monde, and many other outlets.\n\nAt Chicago, I am Director of Knowledge Lab, which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. I also founded and now direct on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an associated Computational Social Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I received my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University.\n\nHomepage\n\nChenhao Tan is an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and the UChicago Data Science Institute.

A recent study led by PhD student Lan Gao and undergraduate students Oscar Chen and Rachel Lee, together with Neubauer Professor Nick Feamster, Associate Professor Chenhao Tan, and Associate Professor Marshini Chetty of the Department of Computer Science, peels back the curtain on content moderation in consumer-facing generative AI products, exploring both the policies written by companies and the lived experiences of everyday users.\n\n### FROM COMMUNITY RULES TO AI TOOLKITS\n\nOnline communities have long balanced the need for open dialogue with safeguards against harmful content. Now, as platforms like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Gemini churn out creative content for millions, the responsibility for content moderation enters new territory. Unlike message boards where only the uploaded posts are checked, these AI tools must also judge the user instructions they’re given—and the responses they generate.\n\nThe research team first analyzed the public policies of 14 popular generative AI tools. They found that while most platforms are diligent about outlining what’s prohibited—ranging from hate speech to copyright violations—the actual guidance is often buried in a maze of terms, FAQs, and support pages. Few spell out exactly how users can report issues, or how they can appeal a moderation decision. In fact, “user-driven moderation” is mentioned far less than in traditional online communities.\n\n### MODERATION: SUCCESSES AND STICKING POINTS\n\nTo understand how these policies play out in the real world, the team dove into public Reddit discussions, pulling from over a thousand posts about content moderation in generative AI tools. Their analysis reveals a nuanced landscape:\n\nSuccesses: Users generally reported that obvious malicious content (think explicit imagery or scams) is blocked effectively—a relief for those concerned about the risks of AI-generated harm.\n\nFrustrations: Innocent creative tasks frequently get tangled in the filters. Fiction writers lamented blocks on violence in historical or fantasy stories; artists hit brick walls over ambiguous word choices. “I just find myself afraid of triggering arbitrary warnings, and then just not using it,” one user reflected.\n\nInconsistencies also frustrated users. Identical requests could get different moderation outcomes, sometimes seemingly dependent on luck — or the particular account being used. Explanations were often generic, with little insight into what went wrong or how to fix it. Appeals, when available, could move at a glacial pace.\n\n“From what we saw in these discussions, the technical limitations and the opaque disclosures of the moderation systems have hampered the users’ creativity and sense of agency with generative AI tools,” said Gao. “These drawbacks could subtly affect how users approach risks associated with AI tools, and shift user’s personal expressions from their original purpose.”\n\n### WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND THE SCREEN\n\nThe implications ripple far beyond hobbyists and tinkerers. In classrooms, journalism, design firms, and beyond, people rely on generative AI tools both for creative inspiration and practical assistance. Overly strict filters and inconsistent enforcement don’t just cause headaches—they risk cutting off valuable new forms of expression and utility.\n\nThe study recommends that generative AI platforms unify and clarify their policies, offer meaningful feedback on moderation decisions, and adopt “soft moderation” (such as warnings rather than outright blocks) where possible. Involving users more directly in reporting and appeals could help platforms learn from mistakes and fine-tune their algorithms. Finally, making the moderation rules and processes more transparent—including the list of banned terms and how decisions are made—could demystify the process for users and enhance trust.\n\n“As generative AI has quickly taken off in the last few years, tool makers have had to put guardrails in place to prevent the creation and distribution of malicious content,” said Chetty. “By improving the transparency and effectiveness of content moderation policies in generative AI tools, we can encourage users to satisfy their curiosity while also minimizing harm.“\n\n### LOOKING AHEAD\n\nAs generative AI becomes ever more woven into daily life, the study’s authors hope these findings will guide both policymakers and product designers. The full study will be presented at the 34th Annual USENIX Security Symposiumin August and the related datasets are publicly available for those interested in delving deeper.\n\nThis story was originally published by the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science\n\n## People\n\n# Chenhao Tan\n\n# Nick Feamster\n\n# Marshini Chetty\n\nPaperOct 24, 2025 Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\n## Why Can’t Powerful LLMs Learn Multiplication?\n\nCampus NewsSep 03, 2025 A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\n## A Bet Worth Placing: Computing and Data Science at UChicago\n\n## More on this topic\n\n## Can a Doctor’s Notes Reveal When They’re Tired?

Alumni who built their own companies or lead entire organizations,” said Ampo. “However, we didn’t have a platform for them to showcase their work. Spark was that platform.”\n\nThe presenters didn’t just bring insights; they sparked action. Priya Suvvaru, MS’23, one of the alumni speakers, reflected: “Speaking at the Spark event was an honor and a great experience. It was inspiring to see how peers are driving change across industries. Sharing my work also sparked valuable conversations with some of our professors and peers, giving me a lot of ideas. I’m already looking forward to the next one.”\n\nBehind the scenes, the goal was always bigger than a one-day event. Spark was built to become a tradition.\n\n“We started this journey with a recurring conference in mind,” said Smith. The vision includes multiple tracks—technical, product-focused, and career-oriented, to allow attendees to tailor their experience. “The energy and powerful messages from the speakers only reinforced my confidence that there’s enough alumni interest to grow Spark, both in attendance and in speaking sessions.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t just about the established leaders. For many, Spark represented a turning point for younger alumni and students on the edge of their careers. “Staying engaged and connected will allow us to learn from each other and solve the latest challenges in AI,” said Ampo. “For early- and mid-career alumni, this is a great way to learn from established alumni and how they’re navigating leadership.”\n\nMittal echoed that sentiment. “Many of us graduating from the program often find ourselves in technically demanding roles, where it’s easy to become immersed solely in the technical aspects of our work. Yet, it’s through these human interactions that we gain some of the most valuable life lessons.”\n\nSpark marked the beginning of something bigger. The momentum from this event is only the beginning as alumni take the lead in shaping what comes next. As Bayowa put it: “A program is only as strong as its alumni network.”\n\nApplied Data ScienceMay 28, 2024 A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students\n\n## A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students\n\nApplied Data ScienceMay 27, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science Team Wins 2nd Place at Transit Hacks 2025\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science Team Wins 2nd Place at Transit Hacks 2025\n\nApplied Data ScienceJul 01, 2025 Hank Snowdon Took a Swing at Data Science and Landed in the MLB\n\n## Hank Snowdon Took a Swing at Data Science and Landed in the MLB\n\nApplied Data ScienceJul 15, 2025 UChicago MS-ADS Students Present Capstone Project at Midwest ML Symposium\n\n## UChicago MS-ADS Students Present Capstone Project at Midwest ML Symposium\n\nPast EventOct 24, 2025 Quarterly Fireside AI | The Practical Impact of GenAI\n\n## Quarterly Fireside AI | The Practical Impact of GenAI",

Her team set out to build an AI-powered dashboard that could help the airline anticipate sudden spikes in passenger demand by tracking signals from news headlines, weather forecasts, and social media.\n\nTheir efforts earned them first place at the Agents in the Sky hackathon, a week-long event that brought together airline professionals and MS in Applied Data Science students to explore how agentic artificial intelligence systems made up of multiple, communicating agents might change the way airlines operate. Agentic AI systems are capable of making autonomous decisions, taking initiative, and coordinating actions to achieve specific goals, often with minimal human intervention.\n\n“We chose this problem because demand forecasting is both high-impact and time-sensitive,” Ji said. “And it’s something that could benefit from agentic AI systems.”\n\nA Week to Build the Future\n\nThe hackathon paired UChicago students and alumni with United Airlines professionals in cross-functional teams. There were no strict boundaries, just one rule: build something useful.\n\nTogether, they worked virtually and in person to design AI-powered tools that might one day assist with everything from maintenance and scheduling to passenger communication and disruption response.\n\nSome teams built systems that interpreted customer reviews to surface recurring complaints. Others created agents that recommended real-time crew scheduling changes during flight delays. Many of the projects focused on automation and insight, and how to use data to make decisions faster, more intelligently, and with more context.\n\nCollaboration in Action\n\nFor Ishwar Ramesh, a data scientist at United Airlines, the hackathon offered a rare opportunity to test new frameworks in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.\n\n“I saw the hackathon as the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into different MCP architectures and understand how agents communicate with each other,” Ramesh said, referring to Model Context Protocols, a new standard in generative AI.\n\nWorking alongside UChicago students, Ramesh’s team built a text-to-SQL LangGraph agent capable of querying real-time flight pricing data from DuckDB via API. He credited the students with introducing him to ReWOO, a token-optimizing model architecture he hadn’t previously encountered.\n\n“We were meeting multiple times a day, even on weekends,” he said. “Everyone was pushing hard to deliver a working solution within the tight one-week deadline.”\n\nSeveral of the resulting prototypes, he added, are now being evaluated for real-world application within United.\n\nNext Stop: Implementation\n\nOmar Naeem, a Generative AI Engineer at United and one of the event’s judges, said the quality and practicality of submissions exceeded expectations.\n\n“We’re actively in the process of presenting the top seven projects to leadership at United,” he said. “This just illustrates how strong we found the ideas to be in terms of solving challenges at United and the airline industry as a whole.”\n\nOne project stood out in particular: Team 12’s Flight Attendant Maintenance Reporting Tool. The system used image recognition, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-to-agent communication to help flight attendants report damaged onboard items by simply uploading photos, automatically populating maintenance forms in the process.\n\n“The students researched well, provided evidence for why this tool would help United, and cited real-world examples where flights were delayed due to maintenance issues onboard,” Naeem said.\n\nA Shifting Landscape\n\nAs airlines continue to invest in generative and agentic AI, both Naeem and Ramesh see significant potential in internal applications, from revenue management and maintenance to HR and operations.\n\n“With the introduction of Agentic AI in recent months, internal applications can now be integrated together, allowing for even more collaboration and insights between teams,” Naeem said. “In my humble opinion, Agentic AI will play a big role in the industry in the upcoming years.”\n\nFor Ji, the hackathon offered a glimpse into the real-world impact of applied data science—and reinforced where she wants to take her career.\n\n“It confirmed that I want to keep working on applied AI problems,” she said, “where data science can directly improve decision-making.”\n\nApplied Data ScienceJul 15, 2025 UChicago MS-ADS Students Present Capstone Project at Midwest ML Symposium\n\n## UChicago MS-ADS Students Present Capstone Project at Midwest ML Symposium\n\nApplied Data ScienceAug 01, 2025 Introducing a New 2-Year Thesis Track for the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n\n## Introducing a New 2-Year Thesis Track for the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n\nPast EventOct 24, 2025 Quarterly Fireside AI | The Practical Impact of GenAI\n\n## Quarterly Fireside AI | The Practical Impact of GenAI",
