These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n- [Machine Learning I](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/#accordion-tab-2)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n- [Applied Generative AI: Agents and Multimodal Intelligence](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/#accordion-tab-2)\n\n\n\n\nThis course explores Advanced Generative AI with a focus on multimodal modeling, a transformative AI paradigm integrating diverse data types—text, images, audio, video, time-series, and point clouds.
