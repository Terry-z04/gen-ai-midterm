Please be clear when entering the U.S. that while you are a student in an online program at the University of Chicago, your visit for immersion weekend is not to attend credit-bearing classes, but to meet classmates and as a result you are coming to the U.S. as a visitor.\n\nRead More +Show Less -\n\n## Curriculum\n\nYou will earn UChicago’s Master’s in Applied Data Science by successfully completing 12 courses (6 core, 4 elective, 2 Capstone) and our tailored Career Seminar\\*.\n\nOur rigorous curriculum is designed by and for data science innovators and leaders. Courses are reviewed annually to ensure the content keeps pace with the [rapidly evolving landscape of data science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/).\n\nYou have the option to pursue the [Master’s in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) degree on a part- or full-time schedule. Part-time students enroll in two courses each quarter and take their courses in the evenings or on Saturdays. Full-time students take three courses per quarter. Some of their courses may be offered during the day.\n\n### Foundational Courses (noncredit, optional)\n\nFoundational noncredit courses are designed and taught by Master’s in Applied Data Science [faculty and instructors](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/instructors-staff/). These optional courses—available at no additional cost— provide the basis for the rigorous Applied Data Science degree. Course content undergirds the theoretical, strategic, and practical data science studies you will encounter in the rest of the curriculum.\n\nBeginning in academic year 2024-25, all entering students will complete a required online Foundational Skills Assessment. This required assessment helps faculty and advisors understand how to best support you once you begin in the program. You may choose to opt-out of taking the Foundational Skill Assessments and instead register for all four Foundational courses. The four Foundational noncredit courses are listed below. Please note that Introduction to Statistical Concepts and R are considered pre-quarter courses and therefore take place during the 5 weeks leading up to your first quarter in the program. All Foundational courses are completed virtually for all students regardless of enrollment in the In-Person or Online Program.\n\nRead More +Show Less -\n\n### Career Seminar (noncredit, required)\n\nIncreasingly, employers demand data scientists and analytics professionals who are not only technically excellent but also superior collaborators, reliable communicators, ethical problem-solvers, and more. To ensure that our graduates remain as top candidates in the job market, we provide tailored support through our required, multi-quarter Career Seminar. The Seminar is designed to counter-balance students’ time commitments in other courses. \\*Students with significant, relevant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this requirement.\n\n### Core Courses (6)\n\nYou will complete 6 core courses toward your [Master’s in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/instructors-staff/) degree. Core courses allow you to build your theoretical data science knowledge and practice applying this theory to examine real-world business problems.\n\n### Elective Courses (4)\n\nYou will complete 4 required electives toward your 12-course degree program.

These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n- [Machine Learning I](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/#accordion-tab-2)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation.

Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n\n- [Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/#accordion-tab-1)\n\n\n\n\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n- [Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/#accordion-tab-2)\n\n\n\n\nThis course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications.

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications.
