A student who takes more than 2300 units will be assessed for any additional units.\n\n## MS in Applied Data Science Courses\n\nCore Courses (5 required courses)\n\n**Statistical Models for Data Science**\n\nIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n**Machine Learning I**\n\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n**Machine Learning II**\n\nThe objective of this course is three-folds – first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n**Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics**\n\nData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\n\n**Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**\n\nTime Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\nElective Courses (3 required courses)\n\nCourse availability varies each quarter, with sample electives including the following:\n\n- Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning\n- Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n- Bayesian Methods\n- Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing\n- Data Visualization Techniques\n- Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice\n- Financial Analytics\n- Health Analytics\n- Machine Learning Operations\n- Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing\n- Reinforcement Learning\n- Supply Chain Optimization\n\nTo maximize curricular flexibility, you may substitute one of the three required MS electives for a Booth elective.\n\nCapstone Project (1 required course)\n\nIn this course, you’ll complete a research-focused capstone project designed specifically for this joint degree. In a small group, you will collaborate with a real client on a relevant data science project across multiple sectors such as finance, entertainment, automotive, and more.\n\n## Booth Courses\n\nLeadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD)\n\nThis course is required of all Full-Time MBA students and is completed during the Autumn Quarter of their first year of residency in the program. The course is designed to enhance students’ self-awareness and interpersonal effectiveness by providing them with an opportunity to benchmark themselves with respect to critical aspects of leadership—working in teams, influencing others, conflict management, interpersonal communication, presentation skills, etc. The course also helps students create a personalized plan to guide their continued development at Booth and beyond.\n\nFinancial Accounting (select one)\n\n- Basic Courses: Financial Accounting\n- Advanced Alternatives: Accounting & Financial Analysis 1, Accounting & Financial Analysis II, Financial Statement Analysis\n\nMicroeconomics (select one)\n\n- Basic Courses: Microeconomics, Advanced Microeconomic Analysis, Accelerated Microeconomics\n- Advanced Alternatives: Topics in Microeconomics Theory\n\nStatistics (select one)\n\n- Basic Courses: Business Statistics, Applied Regression Analysis\n- Advanced Alternatives: Analysis of Financial Time Series; Financial Econometrics; Statistical Insight into Marketing, Consulting, and Entrepreneurship; Data Mining; or any PhD-level statistics\n\nStudents are encouraged to complete Applied Regression Analysis to complete the Statistics foundation requirement. However, it is not required. Students who do not take 41100 can waive the Statistics foundation requirement and, in its place, take 100 additional units of Booth electives.\n\nAdditional Coursework\n\n- Functions, Leadership & Management, and the Business Environment: 700 course units\n- Electives: 400 course units (or 500 if waiving the Statistics foundation requirement)\n\n\n## Admissions Process\n\nApplicants interested in the Joint MBA/MS degree will apply through Booth’s centralized, joint-application process. Applicants should complete the Chicago Booth Full-Time MBA application and select the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science as their program of interest. An MBA/MS program supplement will be available for completion within your Booth application. The supplement contains Applied Data Science specific questions that will be reviewed by the Applied Data Science admissions team along with your full Booth application. For complete consideration, applicants must complete the MBA application and the joint degree program supplement in the same application round prior to submitting the application.\n\nAs part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7.\n\n**Eligibility requirements:** Students who wish to do the joint degree with Applied Data Science must be admitted to and begin the joint programs in the same academic year. Students who have already started their MS or MBA are not eligible for the joint degree.\n\n[Apply Now](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/admissions/apply)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions about the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science Joint Degree Program\n\nI am a student applying to the Booth MBA joint programs and considering the alternatives of MBA/MPCS versus MBA/MS-ADS. What are the main differences in programs and outcomes?\n\nThe fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.\n\nAre there differences between MS-ADS and MPCS in terms of requirements for quantitative and/or programming competencies as an applicant?\n\nThe expectations are similar in terms of STEM aptitude, including undergraduate exposure to Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and experience in internships/industry. Specific requirements differ, with the MS-ADS Program requiring programming skills in specific languages used in Data Science (Python and R). Statistics and Linear Algebra as it applies to Machine Learning are required for MS-ADS. There are enough differences that the background required to prepare for the program is specified within each program’s supplemental requirements page in the Booth application.\n\nAre Applied Data Science foundational courses required?\n\nUpon acceptance into the program, you will be invited to complete online Foundational Skill Assessments about 2 months before Autumn quarter begins. These required assessments help you understand what, if any, content areas you wish to refresh your knowledge for a strong start in program coursework. The assessments also help Applied Data Science faculty and academic advisors understand how to best support you once you begin the program. All foundational courses are five weeks long and held virtually. These courses will not appear on your official university transcript and will not be assessed for a letter grade or pass/fail notation. If you wish to shore up your knowledge in the foundational areas outside of the Foundational courses, [Applied Data](mailto:mailto:applieddatascience-admissions@uchicago.edu) Science can recommend resources.\n\n[The University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/)\n\n## Explore\n\n- [Why Booth](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/why-booth \"Why Booth\")\n- [Degree Programs](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/degree-programs \"Degree Programs\")\n- [Executive Education](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/executiveeducation/ \"Executive Education\")\n- [Faculty & Insights](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty \"Faculty & Research\")\n\n- [Alumni](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/alumni \"Alumni\")\n- [Events](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/events \"Events\")\n- [Recruiting](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/recruiting \"Recruiting\")\n- [Admissions](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/admissions \"Chicago Booth Admissions\")\n\n- [About](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/about \"About\")\n- [Careers at Booth](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/careers-at-booth \"Careers at Booth\")\n- [Media Relations](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/media-relations-and-communications \"Media Relations\")\n- [Chicago Booth Magazine](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/magazine \"Chicago Booth Magazine\")\n- [Chicago Booth Review](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review \"Chicago Booth Review\")\n\n[Request Information](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/why-booth/request-information \"Why Booth?
