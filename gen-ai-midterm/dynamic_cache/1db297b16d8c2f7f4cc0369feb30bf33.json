Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools.

Please be clear when entering the U.S. that while you are a student in an online program at the University of Chicago, your visit for immersion weekend is not to attend credit-bearing classes, but to meet classmates and as a result you are coming to the U.S. as a visitor.\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"button clear button--read-more\">Read More +</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"button clear button--read-less\" style=\"display: none;\">Show Less -</button>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p></p>\n<h2>Curriculum</h2>\n<p>You will earn UChicago’s Master’s in Applied Data Science by successfully completing 12 courses (6 core, 4 elective, 2 Capstone) and our tailored Career Seminar*.</p>\n<p>Our rigorous curriculum is designed by and for data science innovators and leaders. Courses are reviewed annually to ensure the content keeps pace with the <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/\">rapidly evolving landscape of data science</a>.</p>\n<p>You have the option to pursue the <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/\">Master’s in Applied Data Science</a> degree on a part- or full-time schedule. Part-time students enroll in two courses each quarter and take their courses in the evenings or on Saturdays. Full-time students take three courses per quarter. Some of their courses may be offered during the day.</p>\n<h3>Foundational Courses (noncredit, optional)</h3>\n<p>Foundational noncredit courses are designed and taught by Master’s in Applied Data Science <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/instructors-staff/\">faculty and instructors</a>. These optional courses—available at no additional cost—&nbsp;provide the basis for the rigorous Applied Data Science degree.

This required assessment helps faculty and advisors understand how to best support you once you begin in the program. You may choose to opt-out of taking the Foundational Skill Assessments and instead register for all four Foundational courses. The four Foundational noncredit courses are listed below. Please note that Introduction to Statistical Concepts and R are considered pre-quarter courses and therefore take place during the 5 weeks leading up to your first quarter in the program. All Foundational courses are completed virtually for all students regardless of enrollment in the In-Person or Online Program.\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"button clear button--read-more\">Read More +</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"button clear button--read-less\" style=\"display: none;\">Show Less -</button>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p></p>\n<h3>Career Seminar (noncredit, required)</h3>\n<p>Increasingly, employers demand data scientists and analytics professionals who are not only technically excellent but also superior collaborators, reliable communicators, ethical problem-solvers, and more. To ensure that our graduates remain as top candidates in the job market, we provide tailored support through our required, multi-quarter Career Seminar. The Seminar is designed to counter-balance students’ time commitments in other courses. *Students with significant, relevant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this requirement.</p>\n<h3>Core Courses (6)</h3>\n<p>You will complete 6 core courses toward your <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/instructors-staff/\">Master’s in Applied Data Science</a> degree. Core courses allow you to build your theoretical data science knowledge and practice applying this theory to examine real-world business problems.</p>\n<h3>Elective Courses (4)</h3>\n<p>You will complete 4 required electives toward your 12-course degree program. We continually add electives to evolve with the data science landscape. Past electives include Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications, Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing, Data Visualization Techniques, Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice, Quantitative Finance: Methods and Applications, Data Science for Healthcare, Machine Learning Operations, Next-Gen NLP: LLM and Agentic AI in Practice, Real Time Intelligent Systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Supply Chain Optimization.</p>\n<h3>Capstone (2)</h3>\n<p>The required <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/\">Capstone Project</a> is completed over 2 quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/\">Capstone Project</a> in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the <a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/\">Capstone Project</a> two quarters before their projected <a href=\"https://convocation.uchicago.edu/\">graduation</a> quarter.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.</span></p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"accordion__item\" data-accordion-item=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion__indicator\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/#accordion-tab-1\" class=\"accordion-title\" aria-controls=\"accordion-tab-1\" id=\"accordion-tab-1-label\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"accordion-tab-1\" class=\"accordion__content\" data-tab-content=\"\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-tab-1-label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"textblock\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools.

Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"accordion__item\" data-accordion-item=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion__indicator\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/#accordion-tab-3\" class=\"accordion-title\" aria-controls=\"accordion-tab-3\" id=\"accordion-tab-3-label\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Science for Algorithmic Marketing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"accordion-tab-3\" class=\"accordion__content\" data-tab-content=\"\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-tab-3-label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"textblock\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI.

Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance.
