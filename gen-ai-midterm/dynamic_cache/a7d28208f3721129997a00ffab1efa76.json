Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. A combination of online and in-person courses gives you flexibility in course scheduling, and you’ll earn two degrees in the time it would take to complete the MBA alone.\n\n- [Are standardized tests required for admission?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-3)\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions.\n\n- [What are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-4)\n\n\n\n\nThe fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The [MPCS](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mpcs-mba) program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.\n\n\n- [2-Year Thesis Track Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#)\n\n\n- [What is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-0)\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in academic 2026-27, a limited number of In-Person, Full-Time students will have the opportunity to complete a 2-year version of the MS in Applied Data Science program. The 2-year program is completed over 21 months (2 academic years). Students in the 2-year program will complete 18 instead of 12 courses. The additional 6 courses consist of 4 additional elective courses (100 units each); and 2 required thesis courses (100 units each) that culminate in the completion of a required written thesis or thesis project. The thesis will be an extension of students’ previously completed Capstone Project. 2-year program students are highly encouraged to complete a research Capstone (as compared to a traditional, industry Capstone) for various reasons.\n\n\n\nThe longer degree timeline offers more time to engage in academic and professional development while maintaining the same rigorous core curriculum and access to UChicago’s faculty and data science network. The first 12 of 18 courses that students complete in the 2-year program follow exactly the same course progression as those in the 1-year, 12-course program.\n\n\n\nThe 2-year program is not currently available to those in the Online program and/or those pursuing the MS in Applied Data Science on a part-time basis.\n\n- [When can I apply for the 2-year thesis track program?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-1)\n\n\n\n\nThe application portal for the 2-year full-time option will open in **September 2025**. Applicants apply through the same portal as the standard MS in Applied Data Science program. The deadline to be considered for this track is **December 4, 2025**. There are a limited number of spots available in this new 2-year thesis track (18 courses) program. Those who are not admitted to the 2-year program will be automatically considered for the 1-year 12 course program unless they choose to opt-out of consideration.\n\n- [May I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-2)\n\n\n\n\nNo. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters). Any such student must meet with program faculty and staff by the required deadlines in order to maintain good academic standing and/or visa compliance (if applicable).\n\n- [If I am admitted to the In-Person, Full-Time 1-year program, may I take any of the 2-year program electives?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-3)\n\n\n\n\nNo, due to the limited number of spots available for the new 2-year program, the electives are reserved for only those students admitted to the 2-year program specifically. Should anything change, students will be notified.\n\n- [What is the 2-year program's thesis requirement?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-4)\n\n\n\n\nThose admitted to the full-time, in-person thesis track pathway (18 courses, 6 quarters of coursework) are required to complete and submit a written thesis. The thesis will be an individually authored text based on an area of interest from students’ Research Capstone Project. The thesis will be managed through the required thesis courses (2, 100 units each). A lead faculty member with knowledge of the student’s area of interest will supervise the thesis project and provide resources and support as needed.\n\n\n\nAs an alternative to a traditional written thesis, students may opt to complete a thesis project that results in a ‘minimum viable product’ project. Through this option, students will complete a rigorous, multi-step ‘build’ and ‘marketing’ phase throughout the required 2 thesis courses. The thesis project will also be supervised by a program faculty member.\n\n- [How many spots are available in the new 2-year program?](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/faqs/#accordion-tab-5)\n\n\n\n\nWhile subject to change, there are a projected ~50-55 spots available for the 2-year program. For application year 2025-26 (for entrance in autumn 2026), applicants must apply by the round two application deadline (December 4, 2025) in order to be considered for the 2-year program. Students admitted to the 2-year program will take the same 12 courses as those in the 1-year program, but they will complete 6 more courses over 2 additional quarters in their 2nd year of study for a total of 18 courses.\n\n\n[![](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSI_Logo_Color@1x.svg)DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/)\n\nData Science Institute\n\n5460 S University Ave\n\nChicago IL 60615\n\ndata-science@uchicago.edu\n\n© 2025 University of Chicago\n\n- [About](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/)\n- [People](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/leadership-staff/)\n- [Research](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/)\n- [Education](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/)\n- [Outreach](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/)\n- [News](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/)\n- [Events](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news-events/events/)\n- [Jobs](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/jobs/)\n- [Newsletter Archive](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/newsletter-archive/)\n- [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/)\n- [Nondiscrimination Statement](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/nondiscrimination-statement/)\n- [Accessibility](https://accessibility.uchicago.edu/)\n- [Contact](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/contact/)\n\n## Get Updated\n\n- Newsletter Signup\\*\n\n- Phone\n\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\n## Follow\n\narrow-left-smallarrow-right-large-greyarrow-right-large-yellowarrow-right-largearrow-right-long-yellowarrow-right-smallclosefacet-arrow-down-whitefacet-arrow-downCheckedCheckedlink-outmag-glass\n\nNotifications",
