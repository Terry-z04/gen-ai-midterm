Similarly, the optional Foundational noncredit courses are available at no additional cost._\n\n## Curriculum Details\n\nThe Master’s in Applied Data Science program offers two curriculum pathways: a 12-course program and an 18-course thesis track. Both include core courses, electives, a multi-quarter Capstone Project, and a required Career Seminar. The 18-course program includes additional electives and a thesis requirement. See below for a breakdown of each component.\n\n**Foundational Courses** _(Optional, Noncredit)_:\n\nFoundational noncredit courses are designed and taught by Master’s in Applied Data Science [faculty and instructors](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/instructors-staff/). These optional courses—available at no additional cost— provide the basis for the rigorous Applied Data Science degree. Course content undergirds the theoretical, strategic, and practical data science studies you will encounter in the rest of the curriculum.\n\nBeginning in academic year 2024-25, all entering students will complete a required online Foundational Skills Assessment. This required assessment helps faculty and advisors understand how to best support you once you begin in the program. You may choose to opt-out of taking the Foundational Skill Assessments and instead register for all four Foundational courses. The four Foundational noncredit courses are listed below. Please note that Introduction to Statistical Concepts and R are considered pre-quarter courses and therefore take place during the 5 weeks leading up to your first quarter in the program. All Foundational courses are completed virtually for all students regardless of enrollment in the In-Person or Online Program.\n\n**Career Seminar** _(Required, Noncredit)_:\n\nA multi-quarter seminar focused on building real-world skills like communication, collaboration, and ethical problem-solving. Students with 3+ years of relevant full-time work experience may petition for a waiver.\n\n**Core Courses**:\n\nAll students complete 6 core courses that build theoretical understanding and teach students to apply data science methods to real-world problems.\n\n**Elective Courses**:\n\nStudents in the 12-course track complete 4 electives.\n\nStudents in the 18-course thesis track complete 8 electives and 2 independent study courses.\n\nPast electives include topics like Generative AI Principles, Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing, Health Analytics, Supply Chain Optimization, and more.\n\n**Capstone Project**:\n\nA required 2-quarter Capstone Project in which students work in teams to address a real industry or research problem. Full-time students typically begin Capstone in their third quarter; part-time students begin two quarters before graduation.\n\nRead More +\n\nShow Less –\n\n- [Sample Full-Time Schedule](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Prequarter**• 5 Weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional\n\n\n\n\n\n- [Introduction to Statistical Concepts (Foundational) Optional](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-0)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and provides general exposure to basic statistical concepts that are necessary for students to understand the content presented in more advanced courses in the program. 0 units, no cost.\n\n- [R for Data Science (Foundational) Optional](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-1)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and is an introduction to the essential concepts and techniques for the statistical computing language R. 0 units, no cost.\n\n\n**Quarter 1**• 10 Weeks\n\nOptional\n\n- [Python for Data Science (Foundational) Optional](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-0)\n\n\n\n\nThis course is held concurrently with the first five weeks of your first quarter in the program and starts with an introduction to the Python programming language basic syntax and environment. 0 units, no cost.\n\n- [Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Foundational) Optional](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-1)\n\n\n\n\nIf you are required to take this course it will be held concurrently with the second five weeks of your first quarter in the program.

These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n\nCore\n\n- [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-0)\n\n\n\n\nProfessional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.\n\n\nCore (Choose 1)\n\n- [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Letter Grade](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-0)\n\n\n\n\nData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications.
