    Content: ipitated a revolution in weather forecasting by making weather simulations
    faster, lower cost, and more accurate than ever, enabling earlier event prediction

    As one example, in the past year, the AICE team has partnered with the Indian
    government to share AI-supported forecasts with 50 million Indian farmers on a
    weekly basis via text message. In an environment where monsoons can upend a season’s
    worth of cultivation (and livelihood), better forecasts could empower farmers
    to make cultivation choices that work with the weather rather than against it.
    Through a collaboration with the Gates Foundation and the government of the United
    Arab Emirates, the AICE team plans to further democratize forecast access over
    the next three years by training government forecasters across 30 low- and middle-income
    countries.'

    ### Using Image Recognition to Measure the Speed of a Pitch


    One UChicago Applied Data Science Capstone team developed an app that applied
    image recognition algorithms to measure the speed of a pitched baseball. Their
    ace app captured video, isolated the pitched ball, calculated the velocity of
    the pitch, and displayed this measurement so that users would be able to measure
    the speed of a pitch with their smartphones.


    ### Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection


    Credit card fraud puts consumers’ identities at risk while credit card providers
    are forced to cover fraudulent charges. A team of Applied Data Science students
    carefully studied this problem – they created synthetic data that represented
    a large population of credit card users and built a model that catches credit
    card fraud in real time.

  | <code>How does the elective course in Supply Chain Optimization address challenges related to the exponential growth of "Big Data" in large-scale transactional environments?</code> | <code>Title: In-Person Program - DSI<br><br>Content: ct based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.<br><br>Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges.</code> |
