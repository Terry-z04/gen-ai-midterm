May I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program? No. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters). Any such student must meet with program faculty and staff by the required deadlines in order to maintain good academic standing and/or visa compliance (if applicable).",
