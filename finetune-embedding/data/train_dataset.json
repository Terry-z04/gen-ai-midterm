They categorized Trump\u2019s language as divisive, particularly when mentioning political opponents.\n\n### HOW DO WE DEFINE UNIQUE, DIVISIVE SPEECH?\n\nTo support such claims, the authors had to create tools up to the challenge. They implemented three complementary approaches to allow for a multifaceted comparison. One of the approaches employed an innovative use of a large language model (LLM). Large language models are essentially text prediction algorithms that calculate the likelihood of the next words or phases, given a certain context. Based on the ability of LLMs to make these predictions, the authors created a metric called \u201cuniqueness\u201d that measured an individual\u2019s probability of word phrases or sequences compared to other political candidates. For this group of political candidates, this measure compares how likely one speaker is to use the same language and phrasing as another candidate.",

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud.

This talk will present a novel perspective on both, beginning with the surprising observation, first made by von Neumann around 1950, that general computation is at the heart of any living system. Experiments in artificial life (ALife) have now allowed us to observe the emergence of life from random initial conditions (abiogenesis), in the process suggesting a central role in evolution for \u201csymbiogenesis,\u201d the symbiotic merger of existing replicators to form novel ones. When computational entities enter into symbiotic relationships, they must model each other, and when they merge, computational parallelism enables them to become both more complex to model and more powerful as modelers.",

Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes\u2019 theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences.",

What\u2019s the difference between the MS in Applied Data Science and the MS in Data Science programs at UChicago? The two programs share a strong foundation in data science but differ in structure, location, and focus. The MS in Data Science is a 10-course program based on UChicago\u2019s Hyde Park campus. It includes a comprehensive research project and is designed for students who want to dive deeper into the theoretical and research side of data science\u2014often as preparation for PhD study or research-focused careers. The MS in Applied Data Science program offers both a 12-course track and an 18-course thesis track. It is offered in online and in-person formats, with in-person classes held at the NBC Tower in downtown Chicago.",
