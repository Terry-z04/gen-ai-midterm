It is widely used in various fields in today\u2019s business settings.\n\nStatistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the \u201cLinear Normal\u201d assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.",

These experiences tend to stay with us for a long time, often becoming the milestones of our lives \u2014 and highly negative memories can also become intrusive, coming to mind vividly and unexpectedly.\n\nA new study published in Nature Human Behavior adds a new layer to our understanding of why emotional experiences are so sticky. The team, led by Psychology PhD student Jadyn Park, found that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding by strengthening cohesion across brain networks. Using fMRI during more natural, narrative settings, the researchers were able to track how emotional moments triggered a more \u201cintegrated\u201d state in the brain, where different networks that usually play separate roles become more coordinated with one another.",
